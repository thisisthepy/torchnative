"""Load the built `torch._C` shim and resolve `torch.ops.aten.*` callables.

Kept deliberately independent of `sys.path`/cwd tricks: an earlier manual
probe while building this harness found a *different* stray `_C.so` (an
Android build artefact from unrelated, concurrent work) sitting in `/tmp`
and getting picked up ahead of the intended one purely because the shell's
cwd was `/tmp`. Loading by explicit file path through `importlib` sidesteps
that whole class of collision -- nothing here ever depends on `sys.path[0]`
or the process's current directory.
