"""Dtype metadata shared by the golden comparison harness.

DESIGN.md §5 names dtype promotion and quiet numeric drift as the primary
risk of building `torch._C` on top of candle. This module is the single
place that says, for a given dtype name, how close two results are allowed
to be before the harness calls it a mismatch.

Every name in ``TOLERANCES`` must exist as an attribute with the same
spelling on *both* ``torch`` and the built ``_C`` module -- see
docs/TORCH_C.md §1 ("dtype 은 파이썬 상수가 아니라 _C 가 소유하는 타입이다")
for why the shim's dtype names were chosen to match torch's exactly.

# stated ground that construction hung on both sides independently. **That
# ground was wrong, and docs/FLOAT8.md had already disproved it**: construction
# works on both sides and always did. The hang was in `to_dtype(F64)` --
# candle 0.11.0's `WithDType for f8e4m3::to_f64` recursing into itself, which
# release-mode LLVM collapses to `.L1: jmp .L1` -- and construction never calls
# it. An exclusion reason nobody could check outlived the fact it named.
#
# It is included now because the two things that made it uncheckable are gone
# (docs/FLOAT8B.md): 48 ops that computed answers upstream refuses to produce,
# and 37 that hung. Every op now either matches upstream's value or matches
# upstream's refusal, so `expect="match"` is a real question for this dtype --
# a case where one side refuses and the other computes is a SILENT DIVERGENCE
# failure, which is exactly the check that was missing.
