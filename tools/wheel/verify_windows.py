"""What can be checked about the Windows x86-64 wheel without a Windows machine.

    python tools/wheel/verify_windows.py dist/torchnative-*win_amd64.whl
    python tools/wheel/verify_windows.py --self-test

This is the third of these scripts, after `verify_ios_device.py` and
`verify_linux.py`, and the first thing worth saying is that **it reaches as far
as the iOS one and further than the Linux one.** That is a property of the file
format, not of any cleverness here.

The question all three ask is: for each symbol this image does not define, which
library is supposed to provide it? The three formats answer it very differently.

    Mach-O (iOS)    two-level namespace. The linker records, per undefined
                    symbol, which dylib it bound to. Every symbol answers.
    ELF (Linux)     no such thing. `ld.so` searches the whole global scope in
                    load order, so in general the image does not say. Only
                    *versioned* symbols do -- `.gnu.version_r` is grouped by
                    library -- which covers glibc and not CPython, because
                    CPython versions none of its exports (docs/LINUX.md §6.1).
    PE (Windows)    the import table **is** the answer. An import is not a name
                    to be searched for: it is an entry under an
                    IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR that names a DLL. There is no
                    unattributed import. Every symbol answers.

So on Windows the *attribution* is complete, exactly as on an iOS device. What
is incomplete is something else, and it is the same gap Linux has: whether the
named DLL really exports that symbol can only be checked for the DLLs that exist
on this machine.

    python3.dll         present, in the target distribution. **Checked.**
    python313.dll       present. Not used -- an abi3 extension must not bind it.
    vcruntime140*.dll   present, in the target distribution. **Checked.**
    kernel32.dll        an OS DLL. Not here, and not obtainable without a
    ntdll.dll           Windows install. Attributed but not resolved, and
    api-ms-win-crt-*    reported that way.
    bcryptprimitives.dll

That split is worth stating precisely, because it is *better* than the Linux
one in a way that is easy to lose: on Linux the 118 CPython imports could only
be checked as a union against libpython, since the file names no library for
them. Here the file names `python3.dll` for each of them, so a symbol that
happens to exist in some other DLL cannot stand in for a missing one.

What this does NOT say
----------------------

**It does not say the wheel works on Windows.** Nothing here loads anything.
Specifically:

  * **the OS half is unresolved.** ~108 imports name `kernel32.dll`, `ntdll.dll`
    and the ucrt `api-ms-win-*` forwarders. Those are Windows components; this
    machine has none of them and cannot get them. What is established is that
    the image asks for them *by name and by DLL*, and that the set of DLLs it
    asks for contains nothing unexpected.
  * **ordinal-only imports cannot be named.** If an import is by ordinal the
    file records a number, and the name lives in the exporting DLL's ordinal
    table. Those are counted separately rather than passed silently.
  * **`import torch` is not run.** No `LoadLibrary`, no DLL search path, no
    `os.add_dll_directory`. `_load_dll_libraries()` does several things at
    import time that only a Windows machine can exercise -- see
    docs/WINDOWS.md §4.3.
