The distribution on PyPI as `torchnative 0.0.1a0` is `py3-none-any` and holds
only the `torchnative/` skeleton: no `_C`, no vendored tree. `pip install
torchnative` gets you something where `import torch` raises ImportError. This
script exists so that the *default* way to build produces the other thing.

What it does beyond `pip wheel .`:

  preflight   Refuse to build unless `vendor/vendor_torch.sh` has laid down the
              upstream Python tree and `vendor/install_shim.sh` has put our `_C`
              in the hole. Both are gitignored, so a fresh clone has neither,
              and setuptools would happily emit the empty shell again -- which
              is how the PyPI one came to exist. The failure has to be loud.

  freshness   Refuse to build unless the `_C` about to be packaged was built
              from the source on disk now, read off cargo's own dep-info. This
              script does not *build* the cross artefacts -- it picks them up
              from `CARGO_TARGET_DIR/<triple>/release/` -- and until 2026-08-29
              nothing looked at their age, so a five-day-old extension shipped
              with an exit code of 0 and passed every check downstream (§
              `artefact_verdict`, docs/platform/WHEEL.md §11).

  repack      Two fixes that have no setuptools spelling, applied to the
              finished archive (§ `_repack`):
                - `torch-<v>.dist-info/` from upstream, so that
                  `importlib.metadata.version("torch")` answers. transformers
                  gates the entire torch integration on that call
                  (docs/platform/VENDOR.md), so it is load-bearing, not decoration.
                - the Mach-O install name of `_C.abi3.so`, which cargo sets to
                  the absolute path of the build machine's target directory.

  verify      Diff the archive against the source tree file-by-file and fail on
              anything missing. A wheel that is merely *smaller* than it should
              be installs fine and breaks later, at some import nobody ran.

Cross targets (`--target`) reuse all of that and swap three things, which are
exactly the three that are platform-shaped (§ `TARGETS`):

  the extension   `torch/_C.abi3.so` comes from the cross build's target
                  directory instead of from the source tree. The source tree
                  keeps the host artefact, so the suites that read it keep
                  measuring the host.
  global deps     built by the target's compiler, and named `.so` rather than
                  `.dylib` on iOS as well as Android -- `_load_global_deps()`
                  picks the extension with `platform.system() == "Darwin"`,
                  which is False on iOS.
  the tag         `android_<api>_<abi>` / `ios_<major>_<minor>_<multiarch>`,
                  derived from the *target CPython distribution* rather than
                  written down here, and cross-checked against what the
                  artefact itself says it needs.

                  `manylinux_<major>_<minor>_<arch>` inverts that, and it is the
                  one case where the distribution is the wrong source: glibc
                  compatibility is not a property of the interpreter build, so
                  the Linux `_sysconfigdata_*.py` has no field for it. The floor
                  comes from the artefact's own `.gnu.version_r`, which is where
                  auditwheel reads it (§ `LinuxTarget`, docs/platform/LINUX.md §5).

                  `win_amd64` / `win_arm64` are the odd pair: no floor exists to
                  compute, so the tag is a *name*. It is still not written down
                  here -- § `WindowsTarget` derives it from the target
                  distribution's own `sysconfig.get_platform()` branch, because
                  a name reached by analogy with the other one is a guess, and
                  `win_aarch64` is exactly as plausible as `win_arm64` to
                  everybody except pip.

Each non-Apple platform carries two architectures (docs/platform/WHEELMATRIX.md). One of
the nine targets **refuses**: `--target android-x86_64`, because no
x86_64-linux-android CPython exists to derive a tag from and none can be
obtained here -- § `_ANDROID_X86_64_REFUSAL` has the whole reason. It is listed
rather than omitted so the refusal names what is missing, instead of the target
looking like one nobody thought about; `--target linux-x86_64` was in that state
until docs/platform/LINUX.md §9 made cargo-zigbuild work, and is now built and executed.

Then check it for real -- building is not the proof:

    python tools/wheel/verify.py dist/<host wheel>        # installs it
    python tools/wheel/verify_cross.py dist/<cross wheel> # inspects it
    python tools/wheel/verify_android.py dist/<android wheel>    # imports it
    python tools/wheel/verify_ios_sim.py dist/<ios sim wheel>    # imports it
    python tools/wheel/verify_ios_device.py dist/<ios device wheel>  # links it

And check this script itself, which builds nothing and takes a second:

    python tools/wheel/build.py --self-test

#     crate pulls in `src/methods.json`, `src/overloads.json`, `src/surface.json`
#     and `src/bootstrap.py`, and a hand-written glob that missed one would be
#     silently blind to changes in it;
#   * it is per-target, sitting beside the artefact it describes, so the device
#     and simulator answers cannot be confused for each other;
#   * it records *absolute* paths, so an artefact built from a different
#     checkout is visible. A source glob cannot see that at all -- it would
#     compare this tree's mtimes against a binary built somewhere else and call
#     it fresh.
#
# `run.sh` compares bytes rather than mtimes, and deliberately: it *builds*, so
# it has a fresh reference, and a byte compare does not nag when a rebuild
# reproduces the previous output. Here there is nothing to compare against
# without building, which is what was just ruled out. mtime is what remains --
# and reading it off the dep-info makes it the same question cargo asks when it
# decides whether to rebuild, rather than a stricter one invented here.
#
# Three outcomes, kept apart. `run.sh` learned this from `cmp`, which
# distinguishes same (0), different (1) and "the comparison itself failed"
# (>1); folding the last into the middle once produced a staleness report about
# an artefact that was current. The same trap is here in the other direction and
# is the easier one to fall into: `max()` over an empty dependency list has no
# error to report, it just answers "nothing is newer than the artefact" -- so an
# unreadable, unparseable or foreign dep-info would read as *fresh*. Every path
# out of `artefact_verdict` therefore names which of the three it is, and only
# one of them is a staleness claim.

    """PEP 600: `manylinux_<glibcmajor>_<glibcminor>_<arch>`.

    The floor comes from a **different place than on Android and iOS**, and that
    is the whole of what is interesting here.

    Both of those read it off the target CPython: `ANDROID_API_LEVEL` and
    `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` are fields in the distribution's
    `_sysconfigdata_*.py`, so the tag is a fact about the interpreter the
    extension will be loaded by. The Linux distribution has no such field --
    `ANDROID_API_LEVEL` is literally `0` in it -- because glibc compatibility is
    not a property of the interpreter build. It is a property of *this* artefact:
    the set of `GLIBC_x.y` symbol versions its own code references, which the
    linker recorded in `.gnu.version_r`. The highest of them is the oldest glibc
    that can load the file, and nothing else is.

    So `platform_tag` reads the artefact and ignores the interpreter for the
    floor. That is what `auditwheel` does, for the same reason. The interpreter
    is still consulted -- `MULTIARCH` has to say `x86_64-linux-gnu`, or this is
    not the distribution the extension was built against -- but it does not set
    the number.

    A wheel is manylinux only if it *also* depends on nothing outside the
    policy's library list, so `DT_NEEDED` is checked against it. Skipping that
    would let a wheel linking, say, `libopenblas.so` claim a tag whose entire
    promise is that it does not.

    The artefact is buildable on this machine as of docs/platform/LINUX.md §9, with
    cargo-zigbuild; before that it was not, and this class still refuses by name
    when the file is missing rather than dropping out of `--target`'s choices.

    """`win_amd64` and `win_arm64`, which are names and not derivations.

    Every other target here computes a floor from something: Android and iOS
    read a minimum OS out of the target CPython, Linux reads a glibc version out
    of the artefact. **Windows has no floor to compute.** The tag is one of
    four fixed strings (`win32`, `win_amd64`, `win_arm32`, `win_arm64`) and
    carries no version at all; PE records a `MajorSubsystemVersion`, but no
    installer looks at it and pip will hand a `win_amd64` wheel to any 64-bit
    Windows.

    **A name still has to be looked up, and that is what `_platform_name` does.**
    Adding the second Windows architecture is where "no floor to compute" stops
    meaning "nothing to get wrong": `win_arm64` is right, but *by analogy with
    `win_amd64`* it is a guess, and the same analogy produces `win_aarch64` and
    `win_arm64ec`, both of which are also plausible and neither of which any
    installer matches. So it is read out of the distribution instead.

    The chain is short and every link is on disk here:

      * `packaging.tags` has no `windows_platforms`. On Windows it falls through
        to `_generic_platforms()`, whose entire body is
        `yield _normalize_string(sysconfig.get_platform())`. So the tag *is*
        `sysconfig.get_platform()` with hyphens turned to underscores -- there
        is no Windows-specific tag code in packaging at all, which is also why
        `_confirm_with_packaging(tag, "windows")` has always printed a skip.
      * `sysconfig.get_platform()` on `os.name == "nt"` is four lines, and this
        distribution ships them (`Lib/sysconfig/__init__.py`). They test
        `sys.version.lower()` for `amd64`, then `(arm)`, then `(arm64)`, and
        fall back to `sys.platform`. **The order is load-bearing** -- `amd64`
        wins over everything, so the answer for a given distribution is decided
        by which of those substrings its own `sys.version` contains.
      * `sys.version` embeds `Py_GetCompiler()`, which on MSVC is the literal
        `[MSC v.<n> 64 bit (<arch>)]` compiled into `python3<minor>.dll`. That
        string is readable without running anything: `AMD64` in the x86-64
        distribution, `ARM64` in this one.

    So the tag is derived after all -- from the target distribution, like every
    other target in this file -- and `win_arm64` is the *result* rather than the
    assumption. `_platform_name` runs CPython's own branch order over the string
    it finds and refuses if the two distributions ever answer the same thing.

    What `check_image` checks instead of a floor is the two things Windows
    *does* make decidable: the image is a PE32+ DLL of this target's machine,
    and -- in `verify_windows.py` -- every symbol it imports is attributed to a
    named DLL by the import table. That second one has no Linux counterpart
    (docs/platform/LINUX.md §6.1) and is as strong as the iOS device check.

    Two structural differences from every other target, both forced by upstream
    torch rather than chosen here:

    * the member is `torch/_C.pyd`, not `torch/_C.abi3.so` -- `Target.extension_member`
    * the wheel carries no global-deps library at all -- `Target.global_deps_name`

    """`pyemscripten_<abi-version>_wasm32` -- Pyodide, and the one target whose
    tag does not come from a CPython.

    Everything else in this file rests on the principle stated in the header at
    line 55: the tag is *derived from the target CPython distribution* rather
    than written down here. `AndroidTarget` reads `ANDROID_API_LEVEL`,
    `IOSTarget` reads `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`, `LinuxTarget` reads the
    artefact's own `.gnu.version_r`. **The principle survives here and its usual
    implementation does not**, and the gap between those two sentences is the
    whole of docs/platform/WASM.md §9.4a:

        pyodide-lock.json  ->  info.abi_version = "2026_0"     <- the tag
                               info.platform    = "emscripten_5_0_3"
                               info.python      = "3.14.2"

    `2026_0` is Pyodide's `PYODIDE_ABI_VERSION`. CPython's build never sees it,
    so it is in no `_sysconfigdata_*.py`, and it cannot be: it is a property of
    the *runtime distribution*, not of the interpreter build. Ask the
    interpreter the way every other target does and it answers
    `emscripten-5.0.3-wasm32`, which normalises to `emscripten_5_0_3_wasm32` --
    a tag `packaging` accepts, that Pyodide's own `sys_tags()` yields, and that
    **nothing on PyPI is published under**. Wrong in the shape that works.

    That is not a warning, it is a trap: anyone adding a target by copying
    `AndroidTarget` reaches for `self.sysconfig()` first, gets a plausible
    answer, and ships it. So `sysconfig()` below **refuses** rather than
    answering, and names the alternative. A comment would have been read after
    the mistake; an exception is read instead of it. `WindowsTarget.sysconfig`
    refuses for a different reason (the file genuinely does not exist), and this
    is the same shape of guard for the opposite problem -- here the file exists,
    is readable, and is the wrong source.

    The rest is small, which is the finding of docs/platform/WASM.md §9.3: `abi3` is
    inert on this target rather than harmful, so `extension_member` and
    `global_deps_name` are both inherited unchanged. `.abi3.so` really is in
    Pyodide's `EXTENSION_SUFFIXES` and `cp313-abi3-pyemscripten_2026_0_wasm32`
    really is in its `sys_tags()`; this class asserts neither, and
    `verify_cross.py` checks the first against the interpreter's own bytes.

#: Why `--target android-x86_64` refuses on this machine. Written out here
#: rather than inline in the registry because it is the one refusal in the file
#: with a *measurement* behind it rather than a missing package, and the
#: measurement is what makes it a refusal instead of a rebuild hint.
#:
#: The blocker is not the compiler. The NDK's `x86_64-linux-android21-clang`
#: is present and runs (its prebuilt directory is `darwin-x86_64`, and Rosetta
#: executes it), the rust target `x86_64-linux-android` is installed, and
#: `cargo ndk` is on PATH. What is missing is the **target CPython**: every
#: other target in this file reads its tag out of one, and
#: `target-python/x86_64-linux-android/` does not exist.
#:
#: It cannot be downloaded. python-build-standalone's 20260825 release -- the
#: source of the four fetchable distributions in docs/platform/TARGET_PYTHON.md --
#: publishes 871 assets and no Android target among them (checked, not
#: assumed). CPython publishes no Android binaries either. The only route is a
#: local cross-build, which is what docs/platform/TARGET_PYTHON.md §5 records for the
#: aarch64 one, and §5 also records that that build is the one distribution of
#: the five whose provenance could not be reconstructed.
#:
#: And the wheel could not be checked if it were built. docs/platform/WHEELMATRIX.md
#: §3.3 has the measurement: this Mac's emulator ships only
#: `emulator/qemu/darwin-aarch64`, so it runs aarch64 guests and nothing else,
#: and all four installed system images are `arm64-v8a`. So `verify_android.py`
#: -- the one script in the repository that *executes* a cross wheel on the

    unconditional `ctypes.CDLL(torch/lib/libtorch_global_deps.<ext>,
    RTLD_GLOBAL)`, and `vendor_torch.sh` drops `torch/lib/` entirely. Every
    invocation in this repository routes around it with
    `TORCH_USE_RTLD_GLOBAL=1`, which upstream provides for exactly this case
    ("a build environment where libtorch_global_deps is not available").

    That is fine for a source tree and unacceptable for a wheel. `pip install
    torchnative && python -c "import torch"` has to work, and an environment
    variable the user has never heard of is not a thing they will set. Worse,
    the wall-1 branch is not free: it also does
    `sys.setdlopenflags(RTLD_GLOBAL | RTLD_LAZY)` for the whole `from torch._C
    import *`, whose device-side effect VENDOR.md §7 item 4 lists as unverified.
    Shipping the file takes the ordinary branch instead.

    Upstream's copy exists to force MKL/OpenMP into the global namespace ahead
    of libtorch. This build links neither -- `_C.abi3.so` is self-contained
    against Accelerate -- so *empty* is not a stub standing in for something
    real, it is the correct content. The file has to be a loadable image
    though, not the zero-byte marker that `install_shim.sh` uses for
    `torch/bin/torch_shm_manager`; `CDLL` actually dlopens this one.

    Built here rather than in `install_shim.sh` so the source tree keeps
    behaving exactly as every existing doc describes -- wall 1 still stands
    there, and the suites that set the variable are still measuring what they
    say they measure.

    For a cross target the compiler is the target's, not the host's. Handing the
    host `cc` an Android wheel puts a Mach-O where the device expects an ELF;
    `CDLL` then raises OSError, `_load_global_deps` swallows it into the
    `_preload_cuda_deps` path, and the import dies somewhere with no mention of
    this file. The name changes too -- see `Target.global_deps_name`.
