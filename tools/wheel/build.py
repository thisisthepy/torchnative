"""Build a platform wheel that actually contains a torch you can import.

The distribution on PyPI as `torchnative 0.0.1a0` is `py3-none-any` and holds
only the `torchnative/` skeleton: no `_C`, no vendored tree. `pip install
torchnative` gets you something where `import torch` raises ImportError. This
script exists so that the *default* way to build produces the other thing.

What it does beyond `pip wheel .`:

  preflight   Refuse to build unless `vendor/vendor_torch.sh` has laid down the
              upstream Python tree and `vendor/install_shim.sh` has put our `_C`
              in the hole. Both are gitignored, so a fresh clone has neither,
              and setuptools would happily emit the empty shell again -- which
              is how the PyPI one came to exist. The failure has to be loud.

  freshness   Refuse to build unless the `_C` about to be packaged was built
              from the source on disk now, read off cargo's own dep-info. This
              script does not *build* the cross artefacts -- it picks them up
              from `CARGO_TARGET_DIR/<triple>/release/` -- and until 2026-08-29
              nothing looked at their age, so a five-day-old extension shipped
              with an exit code of 0 and passed every check downstream (§
              `artefact_verdict`, docs/WHEEL.md §11).

  repack      Two fixes that have no setuptools spelling, applied to the
              finished archive (§ `_repack`):
                - `torch-<v>.dist-info/` from upstream, so that
                  `importlib.metadata.version("torch")` answers. transformers
                  gates the entire torch integration on that call
                  (docs/VENDOR.md), so it is load-bearing, not decoration.
                - the Mach-O install name of `_C.abi3.so`, which cargo sets to
                  the absolute path of the build machine's target directory.

  verify      Diff the archive against the source tree file-by-file and fail on
              anything missing. A wheel that is merely *smaller* than it should
              be installs fine and breaks later, at some import nobody ran.

Cross targets (`--target`) reuse all of that and swap three things, which are
exactly the three that are platform-shaped (§ `TARGETS`):

  the extension   `torch/_C.abi3.so` comes from the cross build's target
                  directory instead of from the source tree. The source tree
                  keeps the host artefact, so the suites that read it keep
                  measuring the host.
  global deps     built by the target's compiler, and named `.so` rather than
                  `.dylib` on iOS as well as Android -- `_load_global_deps()`
                  picks the extension with `platform.system() == "Darwin"`,
                  which is False on iOS.
  the tag         `android_<api>_<abi>` / `ios_<major>_<minor>_<multiarch>`,
                  derived from the *target CPython distribution* rather than
                  written down here, and cross-checked against what the
                  artefact itself says it needs.

                  `manylinux_<major>_<minor>_x86_64` inverts that, and it is the
                  one case where the distribution is the wrong source: glibc
                  compatibility is not a property of the interpreter build, so
                  the Linux `_sysconfigdata_*.py` has no field for it. The floor
                  comes from the artefact's own `.gnu.version_r`, which is where
                  auditwheel reads it (§ `LinuxTarget`, docs/LINUX.md §5).

`--target linux-x86_64` exists and currently **refuses**: no toolchain on this
machine can cross-compile the crate to Linux (docs/LINUX.md §2, §4 -- a glibc
sysroot, target libc headers and a target C driver are all missing, and the last
of those stops the build before it reaches the linker). It is listed rather than
omitted so the refusal names what is missing, instead of the target looking like
one nobody thought about.

Then check it for real -- building is not the proof:

    python tools/wheel/verify.py dist/<host wheel>        # installs it
    python tools/wheel/verify_cross.py dist/<cross wheel> # inspects it
    python tools/wheel/verify_android.py dist/<android wheel>    # imports it
    python tools/wheel/verify_ios_sim.py dist/<ios sim wheel>    # imports it
    python tools/wheel/verify_ios_device.py dist/<ios device wheel>  # links it

And check this script itself, which builds nothing and takes a second:

    python tools/wheel/build.py --self-test

# against source that had been superseded by a week of landed commits; the tell
# was an error message quoting a phrase no longer in the tree.
#
# Refuse rather than rebuild, for the reason `rust/torch_c/pytests/run.sh`
# refuses to install the shim it found stale:
#
#   * building here means writing down a second spelling of the cross build.
#     The device one needs PYO3_CONFIG_FILE (whose contents live in
#     docs/WHEEL.md §7.1, not in this repository), PYO3_CROSS_LIB_DIR and
#     TORCHNATIVE_PYTHON_FRAMEWORK_DIR; the Android one goes through
#     `scripts/device_android.sh build` and `cargo ndk --platform 21`. A second
#     spelling can drift from the first, and this repository's whole class of
#     recurring defect is a drift that is invisible until a device refuses the
#     file.
#   * this script already refuses when the artefact is *absent*, and points at
#     those same docs. Staleness is that question one notch further in;
#     answering it differently would mean "missing is your problem, stale is
#     mine".
#
# The criterion is cargo's own dep-info file (`lib_C.d`, next to the artefact),
# not a glob written here. That matters three ways:
#
#   * it lists what the build actually read, `include_str!` included -- this
#     crate pulls in `src/methods.json`, `src/overloads.json`, `src/surface.json`
#     and `src/bootstrap.py`, and a hand-written glob that missed one would be
#     silently blind to changes in it;
#   * it is per-target, sitting beside the artefact it describes, so the device
#     and simulator answers cannot be confused for each other;
#   * it records *absolute* paths, so an artefact built from a different
#     checkout is visible. A source glob cannot see that at all -- it would
#     compare this tree's mtimes against a binary built somewhere else and call
#     it fresh.
#
# `run.sh` compares bytes rather than mtimes, and deliberately: it *builds*, so
# it has a fresh reference, and a byte compare does not nag when a rebuild
# reproduces the previous output. Here there is nothing to compare against
# without building, which is what was just ruled out. mtime is what remains --
# and reading it off the dep-info makes it the same question cargo asks when it
# decides whether to rebuild, rather than a stricter one invented here.
#
# Three outcomes, kept apart. `run.sh` learned this from `cmp`, which
# distinguishes same (0), different (1) and "the comparison itself failed"
# (>1); folding the last into the middle once produced a staleness report about
# an artefact that was current. The same trap is here in the other direction and
# is the easier one to fall into: `max()` over an empty dependency list has no
# error to report, it just answers "nothing is newer than the artefact" -- so an
# unreadable, unparseable or foreign dep-info would read as *fresh*. Every path
# out of `artefact_verdict` therefore names which of the three it is, and only
# one of them is a staleness claim.

    """PEP 600: `manylinux_<glibcmajor>_<glibcminor>_<arch>`.

    The floor comes from a **different place than on Android and iOS**, and that
    is the whole of what is interesting here.

    Both of those read it off the target CPython: `ANDROID_API_LEVEL` and
    `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` are fields in the distribution's
    `_sysconfigdata_*.py`, so the tag is a fact about the interpreter the
    extension will be loaded by. The Linux distribution has no such field --
    `ANDROID_API_LEVEL` is literally `0` in it -- because glibc compatibility is
    not a property of the interpreter build. It is a property of *this* artefact:
    the set of `GLIBC_x.y` symbol versions its own code references, which the
    linker recorded in `.gnu.version_r`. The highest of them is the oldest glibc
    that can load the file, and nothing else is.

    So `platform_tag` reads the artefact and ignores the interpreter for the
    floor. That is what `auditwheel` does, for the same reason. The interpreter
    is still consulted -- `MULTIARCH` has to say `x86_64-linux-gnu`, or this is
    not the distribution the extension was built against -- but it does not set
    the number.

    A wheel is manylinux only if it *also* depends on nothing outside the
    policy's library list, so `DT_NEEDED` is checked against it. Skipping that
    would let a wheel linking, say, `libopenblas.so` claim a tag whose entire
    promise is that it does not.

    The artefact is buildable on this machine as of docs/LINUX.md §9, with
    cargo-zigbuild; before that it was not, and this class still refuses by name
    when the file is missing rather than dropping out of `--target`'s choices.

    unconditional `ctypes.CDLL(torch/lib/libtorch_global_deps.<ext>,
    RTLD_GLOBAL)`, and `vendor_torch.sh` drops `torch/lib/` entirely. Every
    invocation in this repository routes around it with
    `TORCH_USE_RTLD_GLOBAL=1`, which upstream provides for exactly this case
    ("a build environment where libtorch_global_deps is not available").

    That is fine for a source tree and unacceptable for a wheel. `pip install
    torchnative && python -c "import torch"` has to work, and an environment
    variable the user has never heard of is not a thing they will set. Worse,
    the wall-1 branch is not free: it also does
    `sys.setdlopenflags(RTLD_GLOBAL | RTLD_LAZY)` for the whole `from torch._C
    import *`, whose device-side effect VENDOR.md §7 item 4 lists as unverified.
    Shipping the file takes the ordinary branch instead.

    Upstream's copy exists to force MKL/OpenMP into the global namespace ahead
    of libtorch. This build links neither -- `_C.abi3.so` is self-contained
    against Accelerate -- so *empty* is not a stub standing in for something
    real, it is the correct content. The file has to be a loadable image
    though, not the zero-byte marker that `install_shim.sh` uses for
    `torch/bin/torch_shm_manager`; `CDLL` actually dlopens this one.

    Built here rather than in `install_shim.sh` so the source tree keeps
    behaving exactly as every existing doc describes -- wall 1 still stands
    there, and the suites that set the variable are still measuring what they
    say they measure.

    For a cross target the compiler is the target's, not the host's. Handing the
    host `cc` an Android wheel puts a Mach-O where the device expects an ELF;
    `CDLL` then raises OSError, `_load_global_deps` swallows it into the
    `_preload_cuda_deps` path, and the import dies somewhere with no mention of
    this file. The name changes too -- see `Target.global_deps_name`.
