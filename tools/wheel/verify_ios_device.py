"""What can be checked about the iOS **device** wheel without an iPhone.

    python tools/wheel/verify_ios_device.py dist/torchnative-*iphoneos*.whl

`tools/wheel/verify_ios_sim.py` proves the simulator wheel the whole way: it
unpacks it into a simulator CPython's site-packages, imports torch inside a
simulator process and computes with it. Nothing here can do that, and the reason
is not caution. It is dyld:

    ios_12_0_arm64_iphoneos's _C.abi3.so, in a simulator's site-packages
        ImportError: dlopen(...): tried: ... (incompatible platform (have 'iOS',
        need 'iOS-sim'))

    the same file, dlopen'd on this Mac
        OSError: dlopen(...): tried: ... (incompatible platform (have 'iOS',
        need 'macOS'))

So "run it and see" is unavailable, on both machines this repository has. That
left the device column of docs/WHEEL.md §7.0 at *built* -- the artefact is a
device Mach-O, its tag is one an installer matches -- with everything after it
blank, and with a note saying a device is required.

**Part of that gap does not need a device.** The device and simulator artefacts
differ in exactly one thing that matters at load time, and it is checkable here:

  * the **simulator** extension resolves its CPython symbols by flat
    `-undefined dynamic_lookup` (docs/WHEEL.md §7.1). All 118 of them are marked
    `dynamically looked up` in its symbol table; the file names no Python
    dependency at all.
  * the **device** extension has no libpython to fall back on, so it links
    `@rpath/Python.framework/Python` and every one of those 118 symbols is bound
    to that library by name, in the two-level namespace.

That binding is a claim the file makes about a library it does not contain, and
it is a claim that can be checked against the library. This script checks it:

  1. `nm -m` the wheel's Mach-O members. In a two-level-namespace image every
     undefined symbol carries the library it is bound to -- not a guess, the
     linker wrote it there.
  2. Resolve each bound library to something on disk: `Python.framework/Python`
     from the device CPython distribution, and the SDK's `.tbd` stub for each
     system library the load commands name.
  3. Ask, per library and not as a union, whether that library exports the
     symbols bound to it.

    torch/_C.abi3.so           222 undefined
      Python      118  <- Python.framework/Python (the device distribution)
      libSystem    88  <- iPhoneOS SDK stub
      Accelerate   16  <- iPhoneOS SDK stub
      unresolved    0

Per library rather than as a union on purpose: a `_Py*` symbol that happened to
exist in libSystem would pass a union check and still fail on a device, because
dyld does not look there for it.

It also checks the thing that makes the simulator result worth anything at all
to the device wheel: **outside the extension and the metadata, the two archives
are byte-identical.** Every one of the 2,685 vendored Python files that
`verify_ios_sim.py` imported is the same file in the device wheel.

What this does NOT say
----------------------

**It does not say the wheel works on a device.** It says the symbols resolve.
Specifically still open, and a device is the only way to close them:

  * **runtime load.** Symbols existing is necessary, not sufficient: dyld also
    has to *find* `@rpath/Python.framework/Python` at load time, which depends
    on the embedding app's `LC_RPATH` and on the framework being in the bundle.
    This script reads a framework off a shared cache directory; an app resolves
    `@rpath` against `@executable_path/Frameworks` (docs/IOS.md §10).
  * **code signing.** Every Mach-O in an iOS app bundle must be signed with a
    profile the device trusts. Nothing here signs anything.
  * **`import torch` completing.** The simulator needed a `_multiprocessing`
    stub and a UIKit-loaded process to get through `torch/__init__.py`
    (docs/IOS.md §4, §5). Whether a real app satisfies those is unmeasured.
  * **any kernel computing**, and any number about how fast.

The ladder, and where the device wheel stands on it, is printed at the end of
every run.
