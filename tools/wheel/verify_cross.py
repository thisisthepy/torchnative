"""Inspect a cross-built wheel. This is not the same judgement as verify.py.

    python tools/wheel/verify_cross.py dist/torchnative-*-android_21_arm64_v8a.whl
    python tools/wheel/verify_cross.py dist/torchnative-*-ios_12_0_arm64_iphoneos.whl

`tools/wheel/verify.py` proves a host wheel by installing it into a clean venv
and watching `torch.__file__` come out of that venv. Nothing here can do that:
there is no interpreter on this machine that an Android or iOS wheel is for.

So this checks the two things that *are* decidable from the artefact, and says
plainly that they are not the same claim:

  the tag is one an installer will match      PEP 738 / PEP 730 spelling, run
                                              through `packaging.tags`, which is
                                              the code pip itself uses
  the contents are for that platform          every Mach-O and ELF member read
                                              directly -- architecture, and for
                                              Apple the `LC_BUILD_VERSION`
                                              platform, which is the only thing
                                              distinguishing an iphoneos build
                                              from an iphonesimulator one
  the pieces `import torch` reaches for        `torch/_C.abi3.so` under a suffix
                                              this target's interpreter actually
                                              searches, the global-deps library
                                              under the name
                                              `_load_global_deps` computes, and
                                              the wall-4 marker
  the archive is internally consistent        RECORD hashes every member, which
                                              is what pip verifies on install

What it does NOT establish: that the extension loads, that `import torch`
completes, or that any kernel computes. For Android that gap is closed
separately by `tools/wheel/verify_android.py`, which runs on a device. For iOS
it is open -- see docs/WHEEL.md §7.

Exit 0 means every check above passed. Any failure prints `FAIL:` lines and
exits 1.

    Two things here have no counterpart in the Android and iOS branches.

    First, `packaging` cannot check the spelling. It has `android_platforms` and
    `ios_platforms` but no `manylinux_platforms`, because matching a manylinux
    tag needs the glibc of the interpreter doing the matching -- it is not a
    function of arguments. So the tag is checked against PEP 600's grammar and
    the skip is printed rather than hidden. This branch is one step weaker than
    the other two and says so.

    Second, the floor in the tag is a claim about *content*, not about a target
    SDK, so it can be checked against the members: `.gnu.version_r` records the
    `GLIBC_x.y` each image needs, and a wheel tagged below the highest of those
    installs onto a glibc that cannot load it. iOS's `minos` check is the same
    shape; Android has no equivalent because an ELF records no API level.
