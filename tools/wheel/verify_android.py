"""Install the Android wheel on a device and prove the torch inside it computes.

    ANDROID_SERIAL=emulator-5554 \
        python tools/wheel/verify_android.py dist/torchnative-*android*.whl

`tools/wheel/verify.py` judges the host wheel by installing it into a clean venv
and checking that `torch.__file__` comes out of that venv. Nothing about that
judgement needs a host; it needs an *interpreter the wheel is for*. On Android
there is one -- on the device -- so the same judgement is available, and this
script makes it rather than settling for `verify_cross.py`'s artefact
inspection.

What "installed" means here, precisely, because it is not `pip install`:

  * the archive is unpacked onto the device's CPython **site-packages**, at
    `<root>/lib/python3.13/site-packages`, which is where an installer would put
    it. Not onto a `PYTHONPATH` directory -- every earlier Android measurement
    in this repository (docs/DEVICE.md) used `PYTHONPATH=$ROOT/site`, and a
    `PYTHONPATH` entry is exactly the thing that can shadow a broken install.
  * `.data/purelib/` is relocated into site-packages, as an installer does with
    that PEP 427 directory. That is how upstream's `torch-<v>.dist-info` gets to
    where `importlib.metadata` can see it.
  * the pure-Python distributions the wheel's own `Requires-Dist` names are
    unpacked beside it, because that is what pip would resolve. They come from
    the host spike venv; every one of them is `py3-none-any` upstream.
  * the probe runs with `-s -P` and from a directory outside the tree, so the
    interpreter adds neither the user site nor the working directory to
    `sys.path`. (`-I` would be the closer analogue of verify.py, but it implies
    `-E`, which discards `PYTHONHOME` and leaves the staged runtime unable to
    find its own stdlib.)
  * `torch.__file__` is then checked to be inside site-packages anyway, rather
    than trusting either precaution.

Two things are measured that the host wheel cannot measure:

  1. **without `TORCH_USE_RTLD_GLOBAL=1`.** docs/DEVICE.md records that variable
     as *required* on Android -- but that was measured against a staged tree
     with no `torch/lib/libtorch_global_deps.so` in it. The wheel ships one, and
     shipping it is the entire argument of docs/WHEEL.md §3.2. Either the
     ordinary branch works now or the file is decoration.
  2. **with and without the `_multiprocessing` stub.** The Android CPython
     distribution builds neither `_multiprocessing` nor `_posixshmem`, and
     `torch/multiprocessing/__init__.py` imports the first at import time. That
     is a property of the interpreter, not of the wheel, so the run is done both
     ways and both results are reported instead of one of them being arranged
     away.

Nothing here installs an app or writes outside `/data/local/tmp/bw_wheel`.
`ANDROID_SERIAL` must be set explicitly; with two emulators routinely up on this
machine, guessing is how the wrong one gets written to.
