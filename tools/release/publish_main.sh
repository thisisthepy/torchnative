# Build `main` as a PUBLISHED SNAPSHOT of `develop`, not a merge of it.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT `main` IS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `main` is what a user who has never read this repository sees: the code that
# is on PyPI, the workflows that verify it, and nothing else. It is not a
# branch anybody develops on and it is never a merge target. `develop` is the
# repository; `main` is one commit per release whose tree is DERIVED from
# develop's.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THIS IS NOT `git merge` PLUS `git rm`
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Deleting files in a merge commit does not stick. If release N merges develop
# into main and then deletes `docs/`, release N+1's `git merge develop` sees
# that main deleted those paths and develop still has them -- and three-way
# merge resolves "deleted on one side, unchanged on the other" as DELETE only
# when the other side is unchanged *since the merge base*. The merge base moves
# forward each release, so every doc develop has touched comes back, silently,
# and every doc it has not touched has to be re-deleted by hand every single
# release. Forgetting once ships the entire documentation tree.
#
# So main's tree is BUILT, not merged. We read develop's tree into a scratch
# index, drop the excluded paths from that index, write the tree, and commit it
# with main's previous tip as its only parent. Because it is not a merge, there
# is no "the other side still has it" to restore anything: each release is a
# fresh derivation from develop and main's history stays linear.
#
# The working tree is NEVER touched. Everything below runs through
# GIT_INDEX_FILE pointed at a temporary file, so `git status` in the checkout
# you ran this from is the same before and after.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY `.github/` AND `tools/ci/` ARE KEPT
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is the entry most likely to be "cleaned up" by a later hand, so the
# reason is here rather than in a document:
#
#   1. All three workflows (`verify-published-wheel.yml`, `build-cuda-wheel.yml`,
#      `qnn-lower.yml`) are `workflow_dispatch`. GitHub only renders the
#      "Run workflow" button for a workflow file present on the DEFAULT branch
#      -- and `main` is the default branch. Stripping `.github/` would not just
#      hide the workflows from main's tree; it would REMOVE THE MANUAL TRIGGER
#      for all three, repository-wide, while leaving the files on develop
#      looking perfectly healthy.
#   2. `.github/` and `tools/ci/` are a pair. The workflows invoke
#      `tools/ci/verify_published.py` and `tools/ci/qnn_lower.py` by path.
#      Keeping one without the other leaves a green button that fails at
#      "No such file".
#   3. `verify_published.py`'s subject is *what is on PyPI*. That is precisely
#      what main represents, so it belongs on the published snapshot more than
#      it belongs on develop.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE TWO CHECKS, AND WHICH ONE MATTERS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   check_leak    no excluded path survives in the published tree.
#   check_build   the published tree still BUILDS A WHEEL.
#
# The second is the real one. A wrong exclusion that removes `tools/wheel/` or
# `vendor/` produces a branch that is spotlessly clean and completely useless,
# and the leak check would pass it without a murmur. CLAUDE.md 5.5: a check
# that cannot fail is not a check, and the leak check cannot fail on the one
# mistake that would actually hurt a user.
#
#   ** THE LEAK CHECK ALONE GIVES YOU A TIDY BRANCH THAT CANNOT SHIP. **
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# USAGE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   tools/release/publish_main.sh --target-ref refs/heads/_publish_test   # rehearse
#   tools/release/publish_main.sh                                          # publish
#
#   --source <rev>       what to publish from            (default: develop)
#   --target-ref <ref>   which ref to move               (default: refs/heads/main)
#   --version <v>        message version   (default: read from pyproject.toml)
#   --skip-build         skip check_build. Says loudly that the round has
#                        only proved tidiness. Not for a real publish.
#   --keep-scratch       leave the build worktree for inspection.
#
# Publishing (and the `git push` that follows it) is the coordinating
# session's action with the user's approval -- exactly as the PyPI upload is.
# This script moves a local ref and pushes nothing.

# --- the exclusion list. -----------------------------------------------------
# `rust/torch_c/pytests/test_publish.py` asserts this exact list, reading it
# out of this file, so the two cannot drift apart: change one without the other
# and the gate goes red.
#
# EXCLUDED, with the reason per entry:
#   docs/                   179 documents of round-by-round measurement notes.
#                           They are the record of how the work was done, not
#                           part of what ships, and they are the bulk of the
#                           tree a user would clone.
#   CLAUDE.md, PROJECT.md   instructions to agents working ON the repository.
#                           Meaningless to somebody consuming the wheel, and
#                           actively confusing on the front page. README.md is
#                           kept -- it is the front page.
#   rust/torch_c/pytests/   the development gate: 50-odd suites that need a
#                           vendored tree, a spike venv, emulators and a Vulkan
#                           ICD. None of it runs from an installed wheel.
#   tools/docwatch/         checks markers in `docs/`, which is excluded.
#   tools/golden/           upstream value-comparison harness; needs an
#                           upstream torch installed alongside, which a user of
#                           this distribution by definition does not have.
#   tools/spike/            scratch probes against the local spike venv.
#   tools/bench/            measurement harnesses; their numbers only mean
#                           anything on this project's own machine.
#   tools/scan/             an audit tool over upstream's source, in the same
#                           class as docwatch and golden above.
#   tools/colab/            a notebook for verifying on a Colab box; developer
#                           tooling, not part of the distribution.
#
# KEPT, and why the non-obvious ones:
#   .github/  tools/ci/     see the block above -- workflow_dispatch needs them
#                           on the default branch, and they are a pair.
#   tools/wheel/            builds and verifies the wheel. Without it main
#                           cannot produce the thing it is a snapshot of.
#   vendor/                 lays down the upstream tree and installs `_C`.
#                           `torchnative/src/main/torch/` is gitignored, so
#                           this is the only way any checkout gets one.
#   rust/torch_c/src/       the extension itself.
#   torchnative/src/main/   the Python package.
#   setup.py  pyproject.toml  LICENSE  README.md
#
# `scripts/` is KEPT on purpose rather than by silence: `tools/wheel/build.py`
# names `scripts/device_android.sh build` as the FIX in its own refusal message
# when the Android artefact is stale, so a main without it would print a
# recovery command that main cannot run.
#
# Paths present in the tree and named in NEITHER list (`rust/vk_probe/`,
# `rust/wasm_probe/`, `rust/torch_c/Cargo.toml`, ...) are KEPT. The list is an
# exclusion list: silence means keep, so a path added to the tree later ships
# by default and has to be excluded deliberately.
