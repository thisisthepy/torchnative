# The (dtype × device) matrix — what computes, what refuses, and the two names that lied

Round date 2026-09-12. Branch `work/dtypedev`, on develop `dc0bc5a`. Host Apple M1
(arm64 macOS, Metal), CPython 3.13, upstream torch 2.13.0 as the oracle,
`candle-core` 0.11.0. **No CUDA, no NPU and no Android device on this machine** —
those columns are reasoned about below and are not claimed as measured.

The ask was *"make it work on every platform, for every possible dtype, on every
possible device."* This round owns the **dtype × device** axis. The API-surface
inventory is a sibling round (`work/gaps`) and is not repeated here.

> **Answer first.**
>
> | | |
> |---|---|
> | Cells computing a **wrong** answer | **none found.** 288 (dtype, device, operator) cells were graded at *agrees* against upstream and every one of them matched. |

> | Largest cell left open, **after the round that went at it** | still `int16` / `int32` on `mps`, still **2 of 23**. §4.2.1 is why it cannot be closed without a candle fork, and what was delivered instead: a refusal that names the dtype, the device and the reason rather than a candle shader symbol. |

## 1. What "works" means here, and how each cell was graded

Three grades are used throughout this repository, and this document says which
one it established for every cell it claims:

| grade | question | how it was established here |
|---|---|---|
| **builds** | can the cell be constructed at all? | `_C._tensor_from_flat(...).to(dtype)`, then `.to(device)` |
| **reaches** | does an operator on it return something rather than refuse? | 23 operators, per dtype, per device |
| **agrees** | is what it returns upstream's answer? | the same computation on upstream torch 2.13.0, compared value by value |

**A dtype that produces numbers on a device and disagrees with upstream is
worse than one that refuses, because it is silent.** That ordering is why the
matrix test grades at *agrees* and why §2's defect is treated as a defect at all:
a `False` that is merely inconvenient is still a false statement about the
machine.

Where a dtype genuinely cannot work on a device — and there are such cells,
Metal has no `double` — the requirement is that it **refuses by name**, saying
what and why, rather than silently downcasting or returning a CPU-computed
answer under a device label. That last failure mode is what
[`../graph/NPU2.md`](../graph/NPU2.md) exists about; §4.4 records where this
matrix comes closest to it.

### 1.1 What the existing harnesses already cover, and the gap this fills

`tools/golden/` diffs 304 operators against upstream across 10 dtypes and is the
authority on numeric agreement. **It has no device axis at all** — read
`tools/golden/build.py`, `cases.py` and `compare.py`: `device` appears as a
*keyword argument being exercised* (`cases.py:15267`, `kwargs={"device": "cpu"}`)
and never as a dimension of the sweep. Every case it runs is a CPU case.

So the gap is not "another comparison harness" — a second one beside the golden
harness would be a liability, and this round did not build one. The gap is the
**device column**, and `rust/torch_c/pytests/test_dtypedev.py` is 23 operators
wide rather than 304 precisely so that it stays the device test and does not
become a second opinion on operator coverage. Where the two overlap (`cpu`,
float dtypes) they agree; where they do not overlap is where this file is the
only thing looking.

`docs/numerics/DTYPE.md`, `BF16.md`, `BOOL.md`, `INT8.md`, `FLOAT8*.md`,
`PROMOTE.md` and `AGREE.md` own the per-dtype numerics on the CPU. This file
cites them rather than re-deriving them, and adds only what changes when a
device is involved.

---

## 2. `torch.backends.mps.is_available()` — the shim computed on Metal and said it could not

### 2.1 The measurement

Through the vendored tree, with this shim:

```
>>> a = torch.randn(64, 64).to('mps'); b = torch.randn(64, 64).to('mps')
>>> (a @ b).device
device(type='mps', index=0)          # it really computed on Metal
>>> torch.backends.mps.is_available()
False
>>> torch.backends.mps.is_built()
False
```

Both halves were constants:

```python
module._mps_is_available = _constant_function("torch._C._mps_is_available", False)
_BUILD_FLAGS = { "_has_mps": False, ... }
```

each justified by a comment saying candle's `metal` feature was off in
`Cargo.toml`. **That comment had gone stale, and it was verified stale before
anything was changed rather than taken on trust:** `Cargo.toml:170` reads
`features = ["metal"]` for the Apple-target entry, `PyDevice::resolve` in
`device.rs` has carried an `mps` arm under `#[cfg(target_vendor = "apple")]` for
several rounds, and the matmul above lands on `mps:0` with upstream's numbers.
[`../devices/DEVICE_NS.md`](../devices/DEVICE_NS.md) §6 had already recorded the
disagreement, measured it, and deliberately left it — on the ground that fixing
it changes behaviour for every caller and reached past that round's request.
This is that round.

**Why it is not cosmetic.** `torch.backends.mps.is_available()` is *the*
standard gate: transformers, accelerate, and essentially all user code that
picks a device branch on it. So a false `False` there does not merely misreport
— it means **nothing built on top of this shim will ever select the device the
shim is already able to use.** Every model load silently lands on the CPU on a
machine with a working GPU.

### 2.2 They are two questions and they now get two answers

Upstream's own docstring for `is_built()` says it *"doesn't necessarily mean MPS
is available; just that if this PyTorch binary were run a machine with working
MPS drivers and devices, we would be able to use it."* Conflating them would be
wrong even on a host where they agree.

| name | question | answer here | source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `torch.backends.mps.is_built()` → `torch._C._has_mps` | **Was Metal compiled into this artefact?** | `True` on this Apple build; `False` on the Android, Linux and wasm artefacts | `cfg!(target_vendor = "apple")` — a compile-time constant, not probeable, and exactly the predicate that gates both candle's `metal` feature in `Cargo.toml` and the `mps` arm of `resolve()` |
| `torch.backends.mps.is_available()` → `torch._C._mps_is_available()` | **Did a Metal device actually open, here, now?** | `True` on this host | a live `PyDevice{kind:"mps"}.resolve()` |

`built` is **necessary and not sufficient**. The case that makes the distinction
real — an Apple build where `available` is `False` — is a Mac VM with no GPU
passthrough, or any host where `MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice` returns nil. **This
machine is not one and therefore cannot demonstrate it**; what is demonstrable
here, and is asserted, is that the two come from different places and that
`available ⇒ built`.

Both are exposed through one new Rust entry point, `torch._C._mps_probe()`,
built as `_cuda_probe()`'s twin and with the same contract: **it never raises.**
A caller asking "is there a GPU here" should not have to catch anything, so a
refusal becomes `available: false` with `reason` (`"not_built"` or
`"no_device"`) and `error` carrying the refusal text.

`is_available()` re-probes on every call rather than capturing a constant at
import — a captured constant is exactly what was wrong before — and that costs
nothing, because `metal_device` already caches the `MetalDevice` per index for
the life of the process.

### 2.3 What flipping `_has_mps` breaks, and why the fix had to include it

`torch/mps/__init__.py:67` is:

```python
def manual_seed(seed):
    if not torch._C._has_mps:
        return
    _get_default_mps_generator().manual_seed(seed)
```

and `torch.manual_seed` reaches it unconditionally through `torch/random.py`.
While `_has_mps` was `False`, **that guard was the only thing keeping every
model script's `torch.manual_seed(0)` off `_mps_get_default_generator`**, which
was an `_Unimplemented`. Measured, by setting the flag and changing nothing
else:

```
NotImplementedError: not implemented in torch._C shim: torch._C._mps_get_default_generator
```

So the honest flag is only honest with a generator behind it, and
`_install_mps_backend` installs both in one place.

**The generator it installs is `torch.default_generator` itself, and that is a
claim about this build rather than a shortcut.** There is one RNG stream here
(`rng.rs`, one process-wide `CpuGenerator`) and every `mps` tensor with random
contents is filled from it: `torch.randn(4).to("mps")` draws on the host and
moves the bytes, and `torch.randn(4, device="mps")` does not work at all yet
(§4.3). There is no second stream for a separate object to own, so returning a
distinct `Generator` would be inventing a state that nothing advances.

The divergence this leaves is named rather than hidden: **`torch.mps.manual_seed(k)`
on its own also reseeds the CPU stream**, where upstream would leave it alone.
`torch.manual_seed(k)` — the call that actually matters — passes the same seed
to both and is unaffected. `_mps_get_default_generator(index=n)` for `n != 0`
refuses by name rather than handing back device 0's stream.

### 2.4 What was deliberately *not* changed

`torchnative.device.mps.availability()` still measures by allocation and still
carries the constant alongside as `detail["declared"]` /
`detail["declared_disagrees"]`. It was **not** rewritten to read the now-correct
constant. "The declared value happens to be right today" is not a reason to stop
measuring — it is precisely how the stale comment survived for as long as it
did. `declared_disagrees` is `False` there now, which is the field doing its job.

---

## 3. The matrix

23 operators — `add sub mul div matmul sum mean max neg abs exp sqrt pow2
softmax cumsum argmax eq where cat clone index0 to_f32 transpose_contig` — over
a 2×2 of the values 1, 2, 3, 4, which every dtype in the table can hold exactly
(including `float8_e4m3fn`, whose grid carries all four, and `bool`, where all
four are `True`). An input a dtype could not represent would make a
disagreement about the *input* look like a disagreement about the operator.

### 3.1 Dtypes this build can store, by device

Every number below was measured on this host on 2026-09-12, against the artefact
built from this tree. "upstream" is torch 2.13.0 in the same interpreter.

| dtype | cpu reaches / 23 | mps reaches / 23 | upstream cpu / 23 | upstream mps / 23 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `float64` | 21 | **0** | 23 | **0** |
| `float32` | 21 | 16 | 23 | 23 |
| `float16` | 21 | 15 | 23 | 23 |
| `bfloat16` | 21 | 15 | 23 | 23 |
| `int64` | 18 | 15 | 21 | 21 |
| `int32` | 18 | **2** | 21 | 21 |
| `int16` | 18 | **2** | 21 | 21 |
| `int8` | 18 | **0** | 21 | 21 |
| `uint8` | 18 | 15 | 21 | 21 |
| `uint32` | 17 | 14 | **13** | **8** |
| `bool` | 12 | 10 | 16 | 16 |
| `float8_e4m3fn` | 7 | 2 | 10 | 3 |

**Grade: `agrees`, for every cell in the "reaches" columns.** Of the 288
(dtype, device, operator) cells where both this build and upstream produce a
value, **all 288 match** within one float32 ULP applied relatively. (288 predates
the `int8` row, added 2026-09-15; its 18 cpu cells are graded by the same test,
which now covers 306, and `int8`'s wrap-around edges — which this matrix's
values 1..4 never reach — by `test_int8.py`.) The twelve
cells that differ in their last bits are all `exp` and `softmax` — a rounding
direction, not an operator — and all sit inside the tolerances
`tools/golden/dtypes.py` already sets for those dtypes.

`_CPU_REACHES` and `_MPS_REACHES` in `test_dtypedev.py` freeze the *exact set*
of cells that compute, rather than these counts. Both directions of change are
red: a cell that stops computing is a lost capability, and a cell that starts
computing is a capability nothing has yet compared against upstream — it gets
graded the moment the set is updated to admit it. Counts alone would hide a
swap.

Two rows are worth reading carefully:

* **`uint32` is a row where this build reaches *more* than upstream** (17 vs 13
  on cpu, 14 vs 8 on mps). Upstream refuses `uint32` arithmetic outright
  (`"add_stub" not implemented for 'UInt32'` on the CPU, `Failed to create
  function state object for: add_dense_uint_uint` on Metal); candle has the
  kernels and this build runs them. That is a *widening*, not a divergence —
  every `uint32` value it produces was checked against upstream's `int64`
  ground truth by hand and agrees — but it is the one row where "agrees with
  upstream" cannot be asserted for the whole row, because upstream has no
  answer to agree with.
* **`float64` on `mps` is `0` on both sides now.** It was `3` on this side
  before this round. §4.1.

### 3.2 Dtypes this build cannot store at all

Ten of the dtypes `torch` publishes have no candle storage here. **Grade:
refuses by name** — `_build` on each raises naming the dtype, and that is
asserted for all ten.

`int8` was the eleventh until 2026-09-15, when the `candle-core` fork gave it
storage ([`INT8.md`](INT8.md) §1.2); it moved to §3.1's table. Its row here had
said upstream reaches 22 of 23 on both devices; re-measured with this file's own
`_cell`, upstream reaches **21** on each (`mean` and `softmax` refuse `int8`).
The test that lists this table failed on the branch that landed the fork —
`int8 built a tensor on the cpu` — which is how the stale entry was found.

| dtype | upstream cpu | upstream mps | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `uint16`, `uint64` | partial | partial | upstream also refuses most arithmetic on these |
| `float8_e5m2`, `float8_e4m3fnuz`, `float8_e5m2fnuz`, `float8_e8m0fnu` | partial | partial | [`FLOAT8.md`](FLOAT8.md), [`FLOAT8B.md`](FLOAT8B.md), [`FLOAT8C.md`](FLOAT8C.md) — only `float8_e4m3fn` has candle storage |
| `float4_e2m1fn_x2` | refuses | refuses | both sides refuse |
| `qint8`, `quint8`, `qint32` | refuses (needs a quantizer) | refuses | `quant.rs` is a separate road |

`complex32` / `complex64` / `complex128` are deliberately outside this table:
this shim holds a complex tensor as a *pair of real tensors* and reading its
values refuses by name on both devices. That is a different axis with its own
documents, and putting it in a device matrix would misattribute a
representation gap to a device.

### 3.3 Devices that could not be measured on this machine

Stated per row rather than left blank, because a blank in a matrix reads as a
pass:

| device | status here | what would settle it |
|---|---|---|
| `cpu` | **measured**, all three grades | — |
| `mps` | **measured**, all three grades | — |
| `cuda` | **not measured — no NVIDIA GPU on this machine.** The `cuda` arm of `resolve()` *is* live on this build (candle's dummy backend compiles on every target) and refuses with `reason: not_built`, which is exercised by `test_cuda.py`. What is unmeasurable is every cell *past* that refusal. | any host with an NVIDIA GPU and a `cuda`-feature build. [`../devices/CUDA.md`](../devices/CUDA.md) |
| `vulkan` | **not measured.** `resolve()` refuses it structurally — candle's closed `Device` enum has no Vulkan variant ([`../devices/VULKAN2.md`](../devices/VULKAN2.md) §5.1) — so there are no cells, not unmeasured cells. | a backend, not a machine |
| `npu` | **not measured — no NPU reachable here.** `torchnative.device.npu` probes and refuses. | an Intel/AMD/Qualcomm NPU host. [`../devices/NPUVENDOR.md`](../devices/NPUVENDOR.md) |
| Android (`androidNative`) | **not measured — no device, and this round was forbidden to touch one.** Note the artefact question is different there: `_has_mps` is `False` on that build *by construction*, and the `mps` arm of `resolve()` does not exist. | an arm64 Android device running the pypackpack bundle |

---

## 4. Cells: closed, and left

### 4.1 Closed — `float64` on Metal now refuses by name

**Metal has no `double`.** That is a property of the API — MSL has no 64-bit
floating type — not of candle and not of this build. Upstream refuses at the
boundary:

```
TypeError: Cannot convert a MPS Tensor to float64 dtype as the MPS framework
doesn't support float64. Please use float32 instead.
```

**This build did not.** `x.double().to("mps")` *succeeded*, because candle will
happily allocate an `F64` Metal buffer. What came back was a tensor that could
be cloned and nothing else:

| call | before |
|---|---|
| `a + a` | `candle: Metal error Error while loading function: badd_f64` |
| `a.sum()` | `candle: Metal contiguous reduce op Sum F64 not implemented` |
| `a @ a` | `candle: Metal error mlx matmul doesn't support F64` |
| `a.to(torch.float32)` | `candle: Metal contiguous to_dtype F64 F32 not implemented` |

The last row is the one that makes this more than an inconvenience: **the
documented escape hatch was closed too.** The object could be made and could not
be converted back, and every message named an internal candle symbol rather than
the fact. This is [`../graph/NPU2.md`](../graph/NPU2.md)'s failure mode in its
quieter form — not a wrong number, but **a capability claim made by construction
succeeding**.

Now, on all three roads onto the device, with upstream's own sentence:

| road | now |
|---|---|
| `torch.zeros(2).double().to("mps")` | `TypeError: Cannot convert a MPS Tensor to float64 dtype …` |
| `torch.zeros(2).to("mps").to(torch.float64)` | same |
| `torch.zeros(2, dtype=torch.float64, device="mps")` | same |

The gate has two halves and each covers a different road:

* `device::metal_dtype_gate` is called from **`PyTensorBase::new`**, which is
  the one constructor every dense tensor in this crate passes through (there
  are exactly two `Repr::Dense` constructors and the other, `boolean`, refuses
  anything that is not `U8`). It was put there rather than at any of the **106
  call sites** that turn a dtype into candle storage, because a gate on one of
  those is a gate with 105 ways round it.
* A second call in `aten._to_copy.default` fires *before* candle does, so
  `move_then_cast` gets the fact rather than `Metal contiguous to_dtype F32 F64
  not implemented`.

### 4.2 Left, and the largest one — `int16` / `int32` on Metal

`int64` reaches 15 of 23 operators on `mps`. `int32` and `int16` reach **2**
(`clone`, `index0`; `cat` in the wider sweep). Upstream reaches 21 for all three.
Every one of the 19 refusals is by name and names the dtype, so this is a
capability gap and not a correctness risk:

```
aten.add.Tensor: candle: Metal error Error while loading function: badd_i32
aten.sum.default: candle: Metal contiguous to_dtype I32 I64 not implemented
aten.contiguous.default: candle: Metal copy_strided I32 not implemented
aten.matmul.default: candle: Metal error mlx matmul doesn't support I32
```

**What it would take:** the missing kernels are candle's, not this crate's —
`candle-metal-kernels` ships `badd_i64`/`badd_u32` and not `badd_i16`/`badd_i32`,
and the `to_dtype` matrix has no `I16→I64` or `I32→I64` arm. Closing it means
either writing Metal shaders into `candle-metal-kernels` (upstream patch, of the
shape `vendor/int8-candle-0.11.0-cpu.patch` already is for another gap), or a
promotion rule in this crate that widens `int16`/`int32` to `int64` before
dispatch on Metal and narrows after. **The second is cheaper and is the one that
needs the argument written first**, because a silent widen-compute-narrow is
exactly the shape this document spends §1 warning about: it would have to be
provably wrap-identical to the narrow computation (it is, for `+`/`-`/`*` in
two's complement; it is not, for anything that saturates) and it would have to
be refused rather than applied wherever it is not. **Not started this round.**

> **Followed up in a later round on `work/intmps`, which did write the argument
> and then could not apply it. §4.2.1 below is that round.** The paragraph above
> stands as written — including its guess that promotion would be "the cheaper"
> road, which turned out to be unbuyable at any price. What it did not know is
> in the first line of §4.2.1.

#### 4.2.1 The wrap-identity argument, and why it cannot be spent here

**The thing the paragraph above did not know: an `int16`/`int32` buffer on Metal
is *sealed*.** Not "a tensor missing some operators" — there is no cast **off**
it in any direction. Measured on this machine, same host, same artefact:

```
int16 -> int64   candle: Metal contiguous to_dtype I16 I64 not implemented
int16 -> int32   candle: Metal contiguous to_dtype I16 I32 not implemented
int16 -> float32 candle: Metal contiguous to_dtype I16 F32 not implemented
int32 -> int64   candle: Metal contiguous to_dtype I32 I64 not implemented
int32 -> int16   candle: Metal contiguous to_dtype I32 I16 not implemented
int32 -> float32 candle: Metal contiguous to_dtype I32 F32 not implemented
```

So the promotion rule §4.2 proposed **opens with a call that does not exist**.
`widen to int64, dispatch, narrow` cannot be performed on the device at all; the
only way to obtain the widening is to read the tensor back to the host, and that
is exactly what `mps_host_readback_gate` exists to refuse — a correct value the
GPU did not compute, returned under an `mps` label. The argument was written
anyway, because it is what a later round patching candle will need, and because
writing it is what surfaced the second half of the answer (the reductions).

**The verdict, per operator.** Reduction mod `2**N` is a ring homomorphism, and
`2**16` and `2**32` both divide `2**64`, so `Z -> Z/2**64 -> Z/2**N` is a
*composition* of ring homomorphisms. Any expression built only from `+`, `-`,
`*` and constants therefore has the same image whether it is evaluated at width
N throughout or at width 64 and reduced at the end — **including when the
width-64 evaluation itself overflows**, because `2**N` divides `2**64`. That
last clause is what makes the answer unconditional rather than bounded by
element count, and it is the clause the obvious version of this argument drops.

The identity also needs the narrowing step to be a **truncation**, not a
saturation, and that is measured rather than assumed — upstream and this build
both give `int64(32768) -> int16` as `-32768` and `int64(2**31) -> int16` as `0`.

| operator | promote through `int64`? | why |
|---|---|---|
| `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `neg` | **provably safe** | ring operations (`neg` is `0 - x`); wrap survives the round trip at every boundary, `iinfo.max` and `iinfo.min` included. `-iinfo.min == iinfo.min` at both widths. |
| `sum`, `prod`, `cumsum` | **safe, and must never be narrowed** | upstream returns **`int64`** for these on an `int16`/`int32` input and does **not** wrap: `sum([32767, 32767, -32768])` is `32766`, the exact sum, in `int64`. There is no narrowing step, so there is nothing to prove — and a promotion that helpfully narrowed back to the input dtype would be wrong for every reduction that leaves the range. |
| `mean` | **not applicable** | refuses on both sides for integer dtypes: `mean(): could not infer output dtype … Got: Short`. |
| `div` | **not claimed** | integer division is not a ring operation. A different argument (value-preserving widening) may well work; it was not written, so it is not asserted. |
| `abs`, `max`, `argmax`, comparisons | **not claimed, and not a dtype gap** | order- and sign-based rather than ring. All of them are *already* refused on `mps` for `int64` too, by the host-readback gate — so `int16` reaching them is not what is missing. |

The `add`/`sub`/`mul`/`neg` row and the reduction row are both **checked**, not
merely argued, in `rust/torch_c/pytests/test_intmps.py`: the promote–compute–
narrow round trip is run on the **cpu**, where both widths have kernels, at
`iinfo.max`, `iinfo.min` and values that overflow mid-reduction, and compared
against upstream 2.13.0.

**The alternatives, and why the third was chosen.**

| road | verdict |
|---|---|
| 1. promotion with a proven wrap identity | **identity proven; road impassable.** The widening cast is itself a missing Metal kernel (above). Doing it via the host is the failure mode this document's §1 ranks worst. |
| 2. real Metal kernels for `i16`/`i32` | **fork only — there is no extension point.** `candle_metal_kernels::DType` (`lib.rs`) has exactly six variants, `F32 F16 BF16 I64 U32 U8`; `binary.metal`'s `init_binary` macro instantiates over the same six; the shaders are `include_str!`'d compile-time constants and `Kernels::load_library` takes a closed `Source` enum. Adding `I16`/`I32` means patching `candle-metal-kernels` **and** `candle-core`'s Metal dispatch — a shader patch in the shape of `vendor/int8-candle-0.11.0-cpu.patch`, but larger, and not something this round could grade across the matrix. Left for a round that owns it. |
| 3. **refuse by name, close nothing** | **taken.** |

**What was delivered instead, and it is a deliverable on its own.** The refusal
was this, for the whole family:

```
aten.add.Tensor: candle: Metal error Error while loading function: badd_i16
aten.mul.Tensor: candle: Metal error Error while loading function: bmul_i32
aten.sum.default: candle: Metal contiguous to_dtype I16 I64 not implemented
aten.contiguous.default: candle: Metal copy_strided I32 not implemented
aten.matmul.default: candle: Metal error mlx matmul doesn't support I32
```

`badd_i16` is a candle-internal Metal function name. It names neither the dtype,
nor the device, nor what to do instead, and it sends the reader into candle's
shader sources to rediscover a fact about **this build's** dtype support. It is
now:

```
aten.add.Tensor: not implemented for int16 tensors on the mps device. candle's
Metal backend in this build instantiates its kernels for float32, float16,
bfloat16, uint8, uint32 and int64 only, so an int16 tensor on mps is storage no
Metal kernel can read -- not arithmetic, not reductions, and not even a cast off
it. Move it with .cpu() to compute on the host with the dtype kept, or cast with
.to(torch.int64) before .to("mps") to keep the computation on the GPU with the
dtype widened. The shim does not widen to int64 for you: the widening cast is
itself one of the missing Metal kernels, so performing it would mean reading the
tensor back to the host and returning a value the GPU did not compute under an
mps label (docs/numerics/DTYPEDEV.md §4.2).
```

Both roads out are named because they are **not interchangeable** — `.cpu()`
keeps the dtype and gives up the device, `.to(torch.int64)` keeps the device and
changes the dtype — and the `int64` road is *run* in the test rather than merely
spelled, because a refusal recommending an unwalked road is worse than one
recommending nothing.

**It is a translation of candle's error, not a gate in front of the kernel, and
that is the safety property.** A gate would have to decide per op whether the op
needs a kernel, and being wrong in the expensive direction would *remove* a
capability in order to reword a message: `clone`, `index`, `cat`, `view` and
`.cpu()` are buffer moves, they work today on a sealed buffer, and they are the
whole reason such a tensor is worth having. Translating on the error path cannot
do that — the success path is never entered. §3's frozen `mps` column is the
proof rather than the promise: it is **unchanged**, `int16` and `int32` still at
`clone`, `index0`, `cat`, and `test_the_dtype_device_matrix_agrees_with_upstream`
still grades every computing cell.

The match is on the dtype token candle puts in its **own** message, in both
spellings it uses — lowercase and suffixed (`badd_i16`) for a failed function
load, uppercase and spaced (`to_dtype I16`, `copy_strided I32`, `matmul doesn't
support I32`) for the "not implemented" family. Matching one spelling only
leaves half the family leaking, and that is a verified nullification below, not
a worry.

**And this is why `int16`/`int32` were *not* gated at construction the way
`float64` was in §4.1.** The two cases look alike and are not. `float64` on
Metal had its escape hatch closed too — `.to(torch.float32)` refused — so the
object could be made and could not be converted back, and that is a capability
claim by construction succeeding. An `int16` Metal tensor can be put down and
picked back up: `.cpu()` is a device move, not a cast, needs no Metal kernel,
and works. It is legitimately useful as staging. Gating construction would have
removed a real capability to punish a missing one.

**Nullifications verified for this round**, each by making the break and
watching it go red:

| nullified | what was seen |
|---|---|
| `name_mps_int_refusal` returns the error unchanged | 3 red — `add` back to `candle: Metal error Error while loading function: badd_i16` |
| `candle_message_names` matches the lowercase spelling only | 3 red — `add` stayed named, `cumsum` leaked `to_dtype I16` and `neg` came back in candle's words. The half-family case, caught. |
| `_wrap` in the test saturates instead of wrapping | 2 red — `test_the_narrowing_integer_cast_truncates_rather_than_saturating` and `test_the_ring_operators_survive_a_promotion_round_trip`, i.e. the wrap argument is compared against arithmetic and is not tautological |

**What `int16` and `int32` reach on `mps` after this round: still 2 of 23, and
0 of the six `add mul sum neg abs max`.** Nothing was closed, and saying so is
the point. Note the ceiling those six have here is **4**, not 6: `abs` and `max`
are refused on `mps` for `int64` as well, by the host-readback gate, so they are
not part of this dtype gap at all.

### 4.3 Left — `torch.randn(..., device="mps")`

```
>>> torch.randn(4, device='mps')
RuntimeError: aten.normal_.default: candle: Metal contiguous to_dtype F64 F32 not implemented
```

`torch.randn(4).to("mps")` works. The fill path draws in `float64` on the host
and converts, and Metal has no `F64→F32`. Fixing it means giving `normal_` a
`float32` path when the target device is Metal, which is small — but it is an
RNG change and `RNG.md` §1.1's bit-for-bit agreement with upstream's stream is
the thing that must not move, so it is listed rather than done. **Not started
this round.**

### 4.4 Left — refusal messages that name `_cpu` on an `mps` tensor

The nearest thing to a misleading result in the whole matrix, and it is a
message rather than a value:

```
>>> torch.zeros(2, dtype=torch.float8_e4m3fn).to('mps').neg()
NotImplementedError: "neg_cpu" not implemented for 'Float8_e4m3fn'
```

`"sum_cpu"`, `"exp_vml_cpu"`, `"argmax_cpu"`, `"add_stub"` do the same. These are
**dtype-level refusals raised before device dispatch**, and the strings are
upstream's own CPU messages transcribed verbatim — so they are accurate about
what upstream would say and misleading about where the tensor is. Nothing
computes a wrong value; a reader is sent to the wrong place. Renaming them
touches every dtype refusal in `aten.rs` and belongs to whoever owns that
family, not to this round. **Not started this round.**

## 5. Wrong answers

**None found.** This is the result this round was most looking for, and it is a
negative one, so it is worth saying exactly what was and was not looked at.

What was checked: 288 (dtype, device, operator) cells across 11 storable dtypes,
2 devices and 23 operators, each compared value-by-value against upstream torch
2.13.0 computing the same thing. Upstream was asked on the **cpu** for every
cell including the `mps` ones, deliberately — upstream refuses several of these
on Metal that it computes on the CPU, and the question here is whether this
build's number is *right*, not whether upstream would have produced it on that
device.

What that cannot see:

* **Any dtype × device pair outside this machine.** §3.3.
* **Operators outside the 23.** `tools/golden/` covers 304 on the CPU; **no
  harness covers them on `mps`**, and extending the golden harness with a device
  axis is the obvious next move and is larger than this round.
* **Values outside 1, 2, 3, 4.** A kernel wrong only at a boundary — overflow,
  subnormal, NaN propagation, the `i64::MIN` wrap `neg_default` is careful about
  — passes everything here. The per-dtype documents in this directory are where
  that ground is covered on the CPU.

## 6. Nullification — what was broken, and whether the tests noticed

Each guarantee was nullified in the source, rebuilt with
`vendor/install_shim.sh`, and the suite re-run. Recorded because a check that
cannot fail is not a check.

| # | nullification | caught by | what was seen |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | `_mps_is_available` back to `return False` | `test_mps_is_available_is_a_probe_and_not_a_constant` | *"torch.backends.mps.is_available() is False but torch.empty(2, 2, device='mps') succeeded"* — the original defect, reproduced and caught |
| B | `_has_mps = False` instead of `probe["built"]` | `test_mps_is_built_is_the_artefacts_own_answer` | *"is_built() is False on sys.platform='darwin' … A False here is the constant coming back"* |
| C | `metal_dtype_gate` short-circuited to `Ok(())` | `test_float64_refuses_by_name_on_every_road_onto_metal`, `test_no_float64_tensor_can_exist_on_a_metal_device`, **and** `test_the_mps_column_reaches_what_it_is_recorded_as_reaching` | *"cast_then_move produced 'made a torch.float64 tensor on mps'"*; the frozen column caught it independently, which is the point of freezing it |
| D | integral `neg_default` computes `1 - x` instead of `0 - x` | `test_the_dtype_device_matrix_agrees_with_upstream` | *"6 (dtype, device, operator) cells compute a value that is not upstream's"* — the wrong-value detector fires, on both devices |

**A and B are separate nullifications on purpose.** Doing them together would
have shown two red tests and proved neither: `is_built` and `is_available` are
different questions (§2.2), and a test suite that cannot tell which one broke
has collapsed them again.

Note what B *did not* break: `is_available()` stayed `True`, because it does not
read `_has_mps`. That is the two-questions property holding under a fault, which
is a stronger statement than the two of them agreeing when nothing is wrong.

## 7. What changed

| kind | what |
|---|---|
| **defect fixed** | `torch.backends.mps.is_available()` and `is_built()` answered `False` on a machine computing on Metal. Both now answer from the artefact. |
| **defect fixed** | `float64` on `mps` constructed successfully and produced an unusable tensor whose only escape hatch was also closed. Now refuses by name on all three roads. |
| **feature added** | `torch._C._mps_probe()`, `torch._C._mps_get_default_generator()`. |
| **tests added** | `rust/torch_c/pytests/test_dtypedev.py` — 11 tests, 4 verified nullifications. |
| **documents corrected** | [`../devices/DEVICE_NS.md`](../devices/DEVICE_NS.md) §6 and the `torchnative/device/__init__.py` module docstring both described the constant in the present tense; both now say what closed it and neither had its *measurement* rewritten. |
| **deleted** | nothing. |

No operator kernels were added this round. The `reaches` counts in §3.1 are
unchanged from before it except for `float64`/`mps`, which went from 3 to 0 —
**a capability was removed, on purpose**, because those three were `construct`,
`clone` and `index0` on a tensor nothing could compute with.
