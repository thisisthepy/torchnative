# FEDERATED2 — rounds > 1: multi-round FedAvg across two operating-system processes

`docs/FEDERATED.md` landed one round of `FedAvg` between two OS processes,
with `torch.equal` acceptance against the same average computed centrally.
This document is the second of those, and it records what makes N rounds
work — the `re_snapshot` lifecycle — and what would go wrong without it.

Measured 2026-09-03, host `darwin/arm64`, CPython 3.13, upstream torch 2.13.0
(`/Volumes/macMini/caches/spike-venv`).

## 1. What "rounds > 1" needed, and why it stopped

`docs/FEDERATED.md` §4 named the missing piece:

> Rounds > 1 (needs re-opening the delta over the aggregated weights —
> `Adapted.online()` never re-snapshots)

The snapshot lifecycle before this round:

```
online()        if _delta is None: snapshot base; create optimizer
                else: just set _online = True
step(...)       forward + capture + backward + optimizer.step + delta.record
revert()        delta.revert (restore from base copy)
```

`online()` is idempotent: it takes the snapshot exactly once, at construction.
That is correct for single-round adaptation where `revert()` restores the
original model. But for multi-round federation, after round 1 installs the
aggregate, the model holds `base + aggregate_round1`, and calling `online()`
again does **not** update the base — so round 2's delta is measured from the
original model and re-sends round 1's cumulative movement. The model diverges
by compounding.

### 1.1 The fix: `Delta.re_snapshot(model)`

A new method on `Delta`:

```python
def re_snapshot(self, model):
    """Replace the base with the current live weights and zero the value."""
    params = dict(model.named_parameters())
    self.base = {n: params[n].detach().clone() for n in self.base}
    self.value = None
    return self
```

Called by `Engine.participate` after each round (except the last):

```python
for round_idx in range(self.rounds):
    self.adapted.online()
    # ... local steps ...
    delta = self.adapted.adapted
    table = delta.publish(...)    # FedAvg aggregate
    delta.value = dict(table)
    delta.apply(self.model)       # install base + aggregate

    if round_idx < self.rounds - 1:
        delta.re_snapshot(self.model)  # next round measures from HERE
```

After `re_snapshot`:
- `delta.base` holds the aggregated weights (the model's current state)
- `delta.value` is `None` (the zero delta)
- The next call to `step()` will record movement from the aggregated weights

### 1.2 What is NOT reset

The **optimizer state** is not reset between rounds. Momentum and variance from
the previous round carry into the next. Whether that matters depends on the
optimizer and the task; it is named here rather than silently decided either way
(DESIGN.md §6).

---

## 2. The acceptance measurement: N rounds, distributed == central

Two OS processes, same setup as `docs/FEDERATED.md` §2: `TCPStore` over
`tcp://127.0.0.1:<port>`, `init_process_group(backend="local", ...)`,
deterministic `TinyLM` with the same base on both ranks, different local data
and different weights (3 and 7).

Three rounds, three adaptation steps each.

*[Results will be filled in once the test suite passes.]*

### 2.1 Distributed against central, per round, element for element

At every round *k*:
- Both ranks start from the same base (verified by JSON equality of the base)
- Each rank produces a local delta from that base
- The weighted average `(3·d0 + 7·d1) / 10` is computed centrally from those
  deltas
- `torch.equal(distributed, central)` — exact, not a tolerance

The critical property: the base at round *k+1* is `base_k + aggregate_k`,
which is the aggregated model from round *k*. Without `re_snapshot`, this would
be the original base at every round.

### 2.2 The stale-base control

The same three rounds are also run *without* `re_snapshot`. In this path:
- The delta always measures from the original base
- Round 2's delta includes round 1's movement plus round 2's local adaptation
- The model diverges by compounding

The control asserts that the stale-base final weights **differ** from the
correct ones, and by more than float noise (>1e-3). This is the proof that
`re_snapshot` matters — without it, the test goes red.

## 3. The Engine road

```python
engine = federated.Engine(model, method=adapt.Tent(), lr=4.0,
                          aggregator=federated.FedAvg(), rounds=3)
reports = engine.participate([{"input_ids": ids}] * 3, weight=n_local_samples)
```

Returns a **list** of `Round` objects, one per round. Both ranks end holding
the same weights after all rounds, which is verified in the test.

The Engine's final weights are checked against the low-level road's final
weights: they must agree, because the Engine is a *use* of `Delta.publish` and
`Delta.re_snapshot` rather than a reimplementation.

## 4. What was scoped out, by name

| | why it refuses rather than approximates |
|---|---|
| `Engine(select=...)` | Unchanged from `docs/FEDERATED.md` §4 |
| `Engine(allow_missing=...)` | Unchanged |
| `FedAvg()` with no `weight` | Unchanged |
| secure aggregation, differential privacy, compression | Not offered at all |
| aggregators other than `FedAvg` | Unchanged |
| non-CPU devices | Unchanged |
| optimizer reset between rounds | Named in the docstring; the optimizer state carries forward. A `reset_optimizer=True` flag that zeroes momentum would be a flag on this loop, not a new mechanism, but it changes the arithmetic and nobody has measured the difference |

---

## 5. What was changed

| file | change |
|---|---|
| `torchnative/src/main/torchnative/delta/__init__.py` | `+re_snapshot(model)` method |
| `torchnative/src/main/torchnative/nn/federated/__init__.py` | `Engine.__init__` accepts `rounds=N`; `participate` loops N rounds with re_snapshot; returns `list[Round]` |
| `rust/torch_c/pytests/test_shim.py` | 3 new tests, updated worker and assertions |
