"""Ground truth table for the QNN/HTP backend: `torchnative.export.qnn_ops`.

Pure tests only -- no ExecuTorch import, no device, no artefact. Everything
this file checks is checkable from the module's own source and from the
installed `executorch` wheel at `/Volumes/macMini/thisisthepy/torchnative/.caches/qnn-venv` that the
table was built from. `docs/devices/QNNOPS.md` is the sourcing record;
`docs/devices/QNN.md` is the (separate, artefact/device) round this table
does not attempt to redo.

The load-bearing tests are the honesty ones: that `check_leaf` never returns
a bare `False` without a `reason`, that every entry in the supported table
really is a `target =` string extracted from the installed package (checked
directly against that package when it is importable, skipping by name
otherwise), and that the explicit refusal lists are disjoint from the
supported set -- a name in both would mean this module contradicts itself.
