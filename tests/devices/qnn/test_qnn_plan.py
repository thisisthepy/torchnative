"""Tests for `torchnative.export.qnn_plan.plan_lowering` -- the QNN analogue of
`torchnative.export.intelnpu.plan_lowering`.

Why this is a separate file rather than more of `test_qnn.py`: everything in
`test_qnn_plan.py` is **pure** -- no ExecuTorch, no Qualcomm SDK, no device,
not even the torchnative `_C` shim. `plan_lowering` walks an `nn.Module` tree
and asks an *injected* op table what it would do with each leaf; the op table
itself (`torchnative.export.qnn_ops`) is a sibling round's file and does not
exist yet in this tree. So every test here builds a small stand-in exposing
exactly `check_leaf(name, module)` (the interface `qnn_plan` was written
against) rather than importing the real one -- which is also what proves
`plan_lowering`'s logic does not secretly depend on anything else the real
module might supply.

This file asks only for `torch.nn` (`_real_torch()` below) and touches no
shim `_C`. That is NOT the same as needing nothing from the environment, and
an earlier version of this note said it was.

It puts the vendored tree first on `sys.path` so `torchnative.export.qnn_plan`
resolves, which also makes `import torch` resolve to the VENDORED torch --
whose `_load_global_deps()` dlopens `torch/lib/libtorch_global_deps.*`, a file
`scripts/wheel/build.py` creates for a wheel and which does not exist in the
source tree. So `TORCH_USE_RTLD_GLOBAL` is required after all, and is set
below the way every other suite here sets it.

The claim survived review because this file was run from a worktree with no
vendored tree, where `import torch` fell through to an upstream install and
the vendored path was never taken. Under `run.sh` it raised OSError eleven
times.

**The trap this file is checking for is silence, not error.** ExecuTorch's QNN
partitioner declines a node it does not accept *silently* -- the exported
program still runs, on the CPU, with a correct answer, and nothing raises.
`docs/devices/QNN.md` (via `torchnative.export.qnn.delegation_report`,
`PteArtefact.htp_plan`) is what shows the after-the-fact split between
delegated and CPU-fallback ops in a real `.pte`; nothing in this file produces
one. So the one property every other test here serves is:
`plan_lowering` must never put a leaf in `eligible` unless the op table it was
given affirmatively said, for that leaf, that it would be taken -- never by
type-name guess, never by absence of a decline reason, never as a default.
