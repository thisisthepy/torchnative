"""Does `device.npu` on Android prove a Hexagon NPU, or only recognise a name?

`_resolve_qnn` used to succeed on `report["htp_arch"]` and nothing else.
`htp_arch` is produced by reading `ro.soc.model` off the device and looking the
string up in ExecuTorch's chipset table. It is a **part number**. It reads the
same on a unit whose compute DSP is fused off, powered down, or simply not
exposed to the uid holding the adb shell -- and it reads the same on anything
that merely claims the string.

Measured on the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra attached to this machine (SM-X910, SM8550,
Android 16 / API 36):

    ro.soc.model      SM8550          -> htp_arch 73, chipset SM8550
    /sys/class/fastrpc  adsprpc-smd, adsprpc-smd-secure   <- and nothing else
    /dev/cdsprpc-smd  absent          (as is /dev/fastrpc-cdsp)
    /dev/adsprpc-smd  crw-rw-r-- system:system   <- shell cannot even open it rw
    QNN runtime libs on device        none (staged_complete false)

and `device.npu.resolve()` returned, confidently,
`<NpuResolution android: qnn -> Qualcomm Hexagon NPU>`. Every input to that
verdict was a name. `adsprpc` is the **audio** DSP; it is present on essentially
every Qualcomm part ever shipped and nothing that runs on it is an NPU
workload. This is `_mps_is_available` inverted -- a hardcoded yes rather than a
hardcoded no -- and it is the same shape as the NNAPI path claiming vendor
acceleration on a tablet that enumerated only `nnapi-reference`.

Nothing here needs a device, executorch, or torch. Each test drives
`_resolve_qnn` with a synthetic report, because the property under test is what
the resolver concludes from evidence -- and the dangerous evidence is exactly
what a green run against real hardware never produces.

Nullifications this file is meant to catch, each verified by making the break
and watching it go red:

* the `htp_reachable` gate deleted from `_resolve_qnn`
      -> `test_a_named_soc_with_no_compute_dsp_does_not_resolve`
* an `adsprpc` node counted as a compute DSP
      -> `test_the_audio_dsp_is_not_accepted_as_the_compute_dsp`
* `htp_reachable` hardcoded true
      -> `test_htp_reachability_is_read_from_the_device_not_declared`
