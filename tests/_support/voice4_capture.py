"""Regenerates `voice4_bigvgan_ops.json`: every aten op voicestudio's BigVGAN
dispatches, captured on UPSTREAM torch under `TorchDispatchMode`.

Not part of the suite -- it needs the network, the NVIDIA checkpoint and a
voicestudio checkout, none of which the gate has. docs/architectures/VOICE4.md §2 is the
setup; point `TORCH_C_VOICE4_ASSETS` at it and run this with upstream torch:

    TORCH_C_VOICE4_ASSETS=/path/to/assets \
    PYTHONPATH=$ASSETS/stubs:$ASSETS/pkg python voice4_capture.py

The capture is of upstream, deliberately: it is the question "what does this
model ASK FOR", which must not be answered by the library under test.
