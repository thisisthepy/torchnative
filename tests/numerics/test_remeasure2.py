"""Guards for the claims docs/verification/REMEASURE2.md corrected in README.md.

Most of that round's corrections already had a test holding them --
`test_collect2.py` for the collectives, `test_train.py` for the convolution
backward rule and the `native_layer_norm` derivative, `test_mpsattn.py` for the
softmax gate, `test_npu2.py` for the Neural Engine and the NNAPI replay. This
file exists for the ones that did **not**, which is the only reason to add a
test at all: a corrected number with nothing behind it goes stale exactly the
way the number it replaced did.

The README said the `mps` host-readback set was **54** ops. It is 85, and it
had been 87 before MPSATTN.md took two out of it. Nothing anywhere compared the
published number to the runtime list, so the drift was invisible -- the same
shape of defect as the golden `ge` floors that could not see `passed < total`
(AGENTS.md §17.5).
