"""Tests for `.github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml` and `.github/scripts/check_tag_version.py`.

The workflow this file guards replaces a manual release: nine wheels built by
hand on one Mac, then `twine upload`. A workflow file whose only check is
running it in production is the thing that round existed to replace, so
everything here runs without a runner -- the YAML is read as text and as YAML,
and the tag/version script is imported and called.

**Nothing here imports torch, torchnative or executorch**, for the reason
`test_qnnci.py`'s docstring gives: a test that skips on this project's own
machine never runs at all, and the decisions being checked are exactly the ones
a green run never exercises.

Four things are checked, and they are not the same claim:

* **the credentials** -- `environment: pypi`, `id-token: write`, and no token.
  PyPI's Trusted Publisher for thisisthepy/torchnative is registered against
  this *filename* plus that environment name; both are load-bearing strings and
  a rename produces a 403 that does not say which one moved. A password or an
  `api-token` input appearing anywhere is a separate failure -- there is no
  PyPI token in this repository and adding one would silently take the release
  off OIDC.
* **the refusals happen before the work.** The tag/version comparison, and the
  nine-wheels check, must both be able to stop the upload. `needs:` is read off
  the graph rather than inferred from job order in the file, because YAML
  mappings have no order that GitHub honours.
* **the nine are named, not counted.** `build.py`'s `EXPECTED_TARGET_KEYS`
  exists because a dict comprehension silently collapsed two entries into one
  and a count could not say which; the matrix here is checked against that same
  list, so adding a target to the registry and forgetting the workflow is a red
  test rather than an eight-wheel release.
* **nothing disables its own assertions** -- `|| true`, `continue-on-error`,
  `set +e`. AGENTS.md §17.5.

The `check_tag_version` half is the part that can be run and falsified locally:
it is given agreeing and disagreeing pairs, including the one a reviewer waves
through (`v0.1.0-beta3` against `0.1.0b3`, which normalise to the same release
and are not the same text).
