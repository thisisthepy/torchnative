"""Tests for the argument-form gaps docs/bindings/ARGFORM.md closes.

docs/architectures/ARCH100.md swept 297 architectures and found six blocked not by a
missing operator but by an argument *form* of an op that already exists:

    torch.ones(dtype=bool)                                     gpt_neo
    Tensor.mean(axis=int, keepdim=bool)                        ibert
    torch.mean(Tensor, axis=int, keepdim=bool)                 imagegpt
    torch.div(int, int, rounding_mode=str)                     longformer
    aten.convolution.default: asymmetric per-axis padding      nystromformer
    torch.embedding(Parameter, NoneType, int, bool, bool)      sam3_lite_text_text_model

plus two more found separately and left in `bootstrap.py`'s territory:

    F.adaptive_avg_pool2d(x, 2) -- a bare int                  dinov3_convnext, efficientnet

Every alias here was checked against real torch 2.13.0 *before* being added
(AGENTS.md's own warning: upstream accepts a numpy spelling on some ops and
refuses it on others, so accepting it everywhere would be a shim more
permissive than the thing it replaces). What each measurement found and what
was done about it is in docs/bindings/ARGFORM.md; this file is the proof the code
actually does what that document claims.

Two of the six are NOT touched here, and are not bugs in this file:

  * the "asymmetric" conv padding was `aten.rs`'s candle backend refusing a
    per-axis-differing value by name -- out of that round's territory
    (`aten.rs`) and a backend limit, not an argument-form gap. **That refusal
    is gone**: docs/kernels/LAST7.md §4 spends the difference as explicit zero padding
    on the input and convolves with the common remainder, so the pin here is
    now `test_per_axis_conv_padding_now_computes_and_agrees_with_upstream`,
    which diffs values, plus
    `test_a_per_axis_differing_stride_is_still_refused_by_name` for the half
    that has no such lowering.
  * the `torch.embedding` case reproduces upstream's OWN refusal (measured:
    `TypeError: embedding(): argument 'indices' ... must be Tensor, not
    NoneType`) -- not an argument-form gap at all, so there is nothing to
    close here; see docs/bindings/ARGFORM.md's note on it.

Also covers the `torch._C._nn.glu` binding wired up in the same round --
docs/architectures/ARCH100.md's `_nn.glu` blocker, seven ASR encoders. The kernel
(`aten.glu.default`) lands on a different branch and is not in this
worktree, so the numeric behaviour cannot be asserted here; only that the
binding exists, is advertised, and reaches the dispatcher under the right
key with the right default `dim`.

    **This test was `test_asymmetric_conv_padding_is_a_backend_limit_not_an_
    argument_form` and asserted the refusal.** docs/bindings/ARGFORM.md §1 measured that
    `padding=[0, 5]` is not asymmetric padding at all -- it is two axes each
    padded symmetrically by a different amount, which upstream computes fine --
    and classified this shim's refusal as a genuine candle limitation rather
    than an argument-form gap. That classification was right about candle and
    wrong about the conclusion: `conv2d`'s padding really is one scalar, but the
    difference between the axes can be spent as explicit zero padding on the
    input, exactly as docs/kernels/RNN.md §2 spent the odd half of `padding='same'`.
    docs/kernels/LAST7.md §4 lands that lowering, so the assertion above became an
    assertion that a working op is missing.

    Inverted into the stronger form: the values, against a reference measured on
    real torch 2.13.0 in a separate process rather than against this shim's own
    other spelling of the same lowering, which would be circular. The kernel is
    `1x6` and the padding is `(0, 5)`, so a lowering that padded the wrong
    candle axis gives `(1, 1, 20, 5)` instead of `(1, 1, 10, 15)` -- the shape
    separates that one -- and a lowering that padded only one side gives the
