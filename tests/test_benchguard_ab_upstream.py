"""`tests/bench/ab_upstream.py` -- the harness that replaces `/tmp/bench.py`.

`docs/perf/PERF.md` was measured by a script outside the repository, so its
numbers could be read but not re-run. The harness now lives in `tests/bench/`,
and a harness nobody checks rots the same way the `/tmp` one vanished. What can
fail here, stated rather than implied:

  * **The op spellings.** Every operator the microbenchmark times is written as
    `torch.ops.aten.NAME.OVERLOAD`, on both sides, precisely so that a
    difference in the Python surface cannot leak into the ratio (PERF.md §0).
    If one of those spellings stops being implemented by this shim, the harness
    does not produce a wrong number -- it raises -- but it raises only when
    somebody runs it, which by construction is after the change that broke it.
    `test_every_benched_aten_spelling_is_implemented` moves that to the gate.
  * **The warmup.** A measurement that times its own first iteration is
    measuring lazy initialisation. `_time` discards `warmup` calls before
    timing `reps`; the test counts the calls rather than trusting the argument.
  * **The interleave and the isolation.** The two torches cannot share a
    process, so each side is a subprocess, and the upstream side must have the
    vendored tree *off* `PYTHONPATH` -- otherwise "upstream" is the shim and
    every ratio is 1.0x with nothing to say it went wrong. That is the
    false-green shape of AGENTS.md §17.5, so the test drives `run_side` with a
    stand-in interpreter that records the environment it was handed.

What this file cannot see: whether the numbers are right. Timing is not
assertable on a loaded machine -- that is the whole subject of PERF.md §0 --
so nothing here asserts a duration.
