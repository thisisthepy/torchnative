"""Is the release consistent with itself, and does it claim only what shipped?

A release is four files that have to agree and are edited by four different
hands: `pyproject.toml` carries the version, `README.md` says what is on PyPI,
`.github/workflows/test-published-wheel.yml` decides which published wheel CI
installs, and `.github/scripts/verify_published.py` decides what is asked of it. Every
one of those has been wrong at least once in this repository, and none of the
mistakes was visible from inside any single file:

  * CI's default stayed at `0.0.9a0` through three releases, so the green runs
    that the README cites as "Linux and Windows compute" were computing an
    older wheel than the one the README's table says is published.
  * A count marker was written `eq` where a later round could legitimately
    raise the number, which turns a correct improvement into a red suite. That
    has now happened three times, most recently in `docs/devices/MPS.md`.

None of this checks whether the release *works* -- the rest of the suite does
that. It checks that the four files tell one story, and that the story is not
ahead of PyPI.
