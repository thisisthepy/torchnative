"""docs/kernels/STRIDED.md -- `as_strided`, and the barrier that makes a gather honest.

`tests/golden/cases.py` compares every value this op answers against upstream
element-wise, including the five refusal messages, and this file deliberately
does not repeat that. What is here is the part a value comparison structurally
cannot hold down: **the aliasing that upstream has and this shim does not.**

`as_strided` upstream is a two-way view. Writes through the result reach the
base and writes to the base show through the result. candle 0.11.0 cannot build
one -- `Layout::new(shape, stride, offset)` is public and
`Tensor::from_storage` is public, but `from_storage` takes an *owned* `Storage`
and allocates a fresh `Arc`, and the nine sites inside candle that do build a
shallow view write `Tensor_ { storage: self.storage.clone(), layout }` directly
against a struct with no public field. Both halves of the constructor are
public and the struct that joins them is not. That was `docs/kernels/TAIL3.md` §6's
refusal and `docs/kernels/TAIL4.md` §1's, and neither is overturned here.

What is new is that the gather's wrongness is made **loud rather than silent**.
`storage.rs::StridedBarrier` bars in-place writes to the result's storage and
to the base's for as long as the result is alive, and the bar is read at
`tensor::write_into`, which is the single write door. So every case where
upstream would have propagated a write and this copy would not is a named
refusal. That is a narrowing of upstream, and this file's job is to prove it is
a narrowing rather than a widening -- in both directions, against upstream
measured in a separate process, and including the two aliasing shapes
`docs/kernels/TAIL4.md` §1.2 named as the ones that defeat every cheaper marker:

  * `z = y.view(-1)` -- a shallow view of the *result*, which gets a fresh
    candle `TensorId` and would escape a `TensorId`-keyed guard;
  * `v = x.view(...)` taken **before** `x.as_strided(...)` was ever called --
    an alias of the *base* that predates the mark, which no field propagated
    forward through the view ops could ever reach.

Both are refused, because the key is the storage and not the wrapper.

Nothing here needs numpy or a network.
