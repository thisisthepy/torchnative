"""Ask an attached Snapdragon device what it is, over `adb`. Never assume.

`torchnative.export.nnapi_device` is the shape this follows, including the two
rules that document earned:

* **`ANDROID_SERIAL` only, never "the one attached device".** The devices on
  this machine are shared with other work, and a command that picks its own
  target lands on somebody else's.
* **Write only under one directory this project owns by name**, install
  nothing, and remove what was pushed.

What is different is the question. NNAPI's runtime enumerates its own drivers,
so `nnapi_device.devices()` could ask the *runtime* what it had. QNN has no
such call before a backend is initialised, and initialising one needs the
Qualcomm libraries already staged on the device. So the SoC is read from
Android's own properties and mapped through **ExecuTorch's** chipset table
(`torchnative.export.qnn.resolve_soc`), and the HTP libraries are located by
looking for the files.

Nothing here executes a model. docs/devices/QNN.md §6.4 says why: this round could not
lower a QNN artefact -- the host cannot -- so there is nothing to execute, and
a module that ran *something* and reported success would be reporting on the
CPU path. What this module does is answer the two questions the device
procedure in docs/devices/QNN.md §5 starts with, from the device rather than from a
guess: **which SoC is this** and **is the HTP reachable**.

Those two are answered by different evidence and must not be run together. The
SoC is a *name*, mapped through a table; it describes the part number, and it
reads the same on a unit whose cDSP is fused off, powered down, or not exposed
to userspace at all. Only `htp_reachable` answers the second question, and it
answers it from the FastRPC compute-DSP endpoints -- see `CDSP_FASTRPC_NODES`
for the measurement that forced the two apart.
