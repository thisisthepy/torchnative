"""Where torchnative is allowed to write derived artefacts, on each platform.

`docs/devices/NPUCACHE.md` is the design record. This module exists because the
Intel NPU round needed somewhere to point `ov::cache_dir` and this repository
had **no cache-path convention at all** -- no `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, no
`%LOCALAPPDATA%`, no `~/Library/Caches`, no `HF_HOME` handling anywhere under
`torchnative/`. So this file is the house rule, and the QNN and CoreML caches
that come later are expected to call `backend_cache_dir` rather than invent a
second one.

**Pure, and injectable, on purpose.** `cache_root` takes the platform string and
the environment as arguments instead of reading `sys.platform` and `os.environ`,
which is the shape `torchnative.export.intelnpu.library_candidates(platform=...)`
already established for the same reason: this project ships wheels for macOS,
Linux, Windows, Android, iOS and wasm32, and a path rule that is right on Linux
and wrong on Windows is exactly the defect no single-platform test run would
catch. Every one of the six answers is decided here and asserted in
`tests/test_ovcache.py`, from whichever one machine is running.

**What each platform gets, and why that one:**

  ``win32``        ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\torchnative\\Cache``. Local, never
                   ``%APPDATA%``: a compiled NPU blob is keyed on this machine's
                   driver and device, so roaming it to another host is shipping
                   a cache entry to a machine it was not compiled for.
                   ``XDG_CACHE_HOME`` is deliberately *not* consulted here --
                   a Windows user with git-bash or WSL interop in their
                   environment must not get a different answer than one without.
  ``darwin``       ``~/Library/Caches/torchnative``. The macOS convention, and
                   the directory ``NSCachesDirectory`` names.
  ``linux``        ``$XDG_CACHE_HOME/torchnative``, defaulting to
                   ``~/.cache/torchnative`` per the XDG base directory spec.
  ``android``      the same XDG shape, which lands *inside app-private storage*
                   because CPython on Android (PEP 738, and Chaquopy before it)
                   sets ``HOME`` to the application's own files directory. There
                   is no world-writable location on Android and this does not
                   look for one.
  ``ios``          ``~/Library/Caches/torchnative`` -- the same rule as macOS,
                   and correct for the same reason: ``HOME`` inside the iOS
                   sandbox is the app container, so this is
                   ``<container>/Library/Caches``. That directory is purgeable
                   by the OS under disk pressure, which is the right property
                   for a cache and the reason it is not ``Application Support``.
  ``emscripten``   ``None``.
  ``wasi``         ``None``. Neither has a persistent filesystem by default, so
                   there is nothing a cache could survive in; returning ``None``
                   says that rather than writing into a MEMFS that vanishes.

**Why not under the Hugging Face cache.** These artefacts are derived from HF
checkpoints, so ``HF_HOME``/``HF_HUB_CACHE`` is a genuine candidate: it keeps a
model's derived files next to it and inherits a disk-location choice the user
has already made. It was rejected. ``huggingface_hub`` owns that tree's layout
and prunes it -- ``huggingface-cli delete-cache`` walks ``models--*/blobs`` and
``snapshots`` and removes what it does not recognise as its own -- so a
directory we put there is somewhere between "at risk" and "someone else's". It
is also undefined for the inputs that never came from the Hub (a local
``safetensors`` file, a ``state_dict``), which is a real fraction of what this
library lowers. And PROJECT.md's position on not writing into another
distribution's directory layout applies to a cache tree as much as to a package
tree. What is kept from the argument on the other side is the *inheritance*: the
user's disk-location choice is still honoured, one level up, through
``XDG_CACHE_HOME``/``%LOCALAPPDATA%`` and through the two overrides below.

**Off is a first-class answer.** ``None`` means "do not cache", and it is the
same value the wasm platforms return, so a caller has one no-cache state to
handle and not two. A shared or network home, CI, and a read-only filesystem all
need that value to be reachable, which is what ``TORCHNATIVE_CACHE_DIR=0`` does.

    # The first version of this function used each OS's native convention:
    # %LOCALAPPDATA%\torchnative\Cache on Windows, ~/Library/Caches on macOS
    # and iOS, XDG elsewhere. That is what a desktop application should do, and
    # it is the wrong answer here, because it makes torchnative the odd one out
    # among the caches a user of this library already has.
    #
    # The two that matter both ignore the OS convention:
    #
    #   torch/hub.py:91                     DEFAULT_CACHE_DIR = "~/.cache"
    #   huggingface_hub/constants.py:157    ~/.cache, XDG_CACHE_HOME first
    #
    # Neither consults `sys.platform`. On Windows a user's checkpoints are
    # already in C:\Users\<u>\.cache\huggingface and torch's hub artefacts in
    # C:\Users\<u>\.cache\torch. Sending only the NPU blobs to
    # %LOCALAPPDATA% splits one thing across two places for a tidiness nobody
    # asked for. We ship that torch, so its convention is not a foreign one.
    #
    # iOS is not special-cased either. `~/Library/Caches` there is genuinely
    # OS-purgeable, which is the right property for a cache -- but if that
    # mattered enough to branch on, `huggingface_hub` would have to branch on it
    # too, and it does not. `~/.cache` on iOS is inside the app container and
    # works; it simply is not purgeable. One rule, and the exception is the
    # platform with no filesystem, not the platform with a nicer directory.
    #
    # MOBILE. On Android and iOS the correct directory is one only the host app
    # knows: `Context.getCacheDir()` (`/data/data/<pkg>/cache`) and the sandbox
    # container's `Library/Caches`. Both need a JNI Context or an Objective-C
    # container URL; a pure-Python process cannot compute either. `$HOME/.cache`
    # there is app-PRIVATE but it is app DATA, not app cache -- Android will not
    # reclaim it under storage pressure and "Clear cache" will not touch it.
    #
    # It is still the right fallback. The alternative considered was to return
    # None on mobile so nothing is cached until an embedder says where -- and
    # that is worse, by a lot: it means recompiling every leaf on every launch
    # (504 driver compiles for a Qwen3-4B) on exactly the devices where compute
    # is scarcest. A cache in a less-reclaimable directory beats no cache.
    #
    # So the embedder sets `TORCHNATIVE_CACHE_DIR` (it already exists; see
    # above) and gets the correct directory; an embedder that does not still
    # gets a working cache. docs/devices/NPUCACHE.md records this as the one
    # thing a mobile host should configure.
    #
    # Android needs no branch beyond that: CPython there (PEP 738, Chaquopy)
    # sets HOME to the app's own files directory, so `$HOME/.cache` is at least
    # inside app-private storage rather than anywhere shared.
    #
    # Windows roaming was the stated reason for %LOCALAPPDATA%, since a compiled
    # NPU blob is keyed to this machine's driver. It is not a real risk:
    # `~/.cache` resolves under %USERPROFILE%, which is not the roaming
    # `%APPDATA%` tree, and HF already keeps multi-gigabyte checkpoints there.
