"""The `local` backend -- `torch.distributed` with a world of one.

DESIGN.md §11.1 puts four layers in a stack::

    torchnative.nn.federated   rounds, client selection, aggregation
      └ torch.distributed      ProcessGroup, collectives
          └ backends           ours, registered with register_backend
              └ devices        CPU, Metal, Vulkan, NPU

This module is the third layer's registration. The collectives themselves live
in ``torch._C._distributed_c10d.ProcessGroupLocal`` -- upstream builds its
backends in C++ and this project replaces that half, so that is where they
belong. What has to happen in Python is the *registration*, because
``Backend.register_backend`` is an API of ``torch.distributed.distributed_c10d``
and ``_C`` is imported before that file exists.

Why here rather than in the vendored tree: DESIGN.md §1 forbids a facade, and
IMPORT_TORCH.md records that the vendored tree is not edited. Registering from
``torchnative`` uses the extension point upstream published for exactly this.

**What this backend is, and is not.** It is the honest world_size-1 case, not a
simulation of a larger one. ``docs/DISTRIBUTED.md`` has the table; the short
version is that reductions are the identity, ``broadcast`` and ``barrier`` are
no-ops that are *true* rather than convenient, the gather/scatter family
copies, and ``send``/``recv`` refuse by name because no amount of local work
makes them mean anything. It is deliberately not ``fake``: upstream's own
``FakeProcessGroup`` docstring says it "would produce wrong results for every
collective", and a wrong result is worse than a refusal.
