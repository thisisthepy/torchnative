"""`torchnative.device` --- a device namespace this project owns.

    import torchnative
    torchnative.device.cpu        eager
    torchnative.device.mps        eager
    torchnative.device.vulkan     eager
    torchnative.device.cuda       eager
    torchnative.device.npu        compiled target, resolved per host

**Why not `torch.device("npu")`.** PyTorch has no `npu` device type. Making it
appear to have one --- `_rename_privateuse1_backend`, a PrivateUse1
registration --- would be a claim *about PyTorch* that is not true, and the
label would then be accepted by every spelling that takes a device without any
of them being able to honour it. `docs/devices/DEVICE_ABS.md` section 7.3 records
`_rename_privateuse1_backend` as unimplemented and says the demand for it was
never measured; this module is the reason it stays that way. The namespace is
ours, so it can carry meaning ours can honour.

**Two kinds of device, and the type says which.**

`cpu`, `mps`, `vulkan` and `cuda` are `EagerDevice`: they dispatch operator by
operator, they are tensor destinations, and `.torch_device` hands back the
`torch.device` that names them. `npu` is a `CompiledDevice`: an NPU takes a
whole subgraph ahead of time and cannot be handed single operators
(CLAUDE.md section 8), so it is not a tensor destination and `.torch_device`
refuses by name. That is not a convention --- it is the absence of an
attribute, so the wrong use cannot be spelled.

**Availability is measured, and every answer says what measured it.**
`Availability.source` names the probe and `Availability.kind` is `"measured"`
or `"declared"`. Nothing here invents a probe: `_vulkan_probe`, `_cuda_probe`,
`intelnpu.npu_available`, `qnn_device.device_report` and CoreML's own
`MLComputeDevice.get_all_compute_devices` are the existing ones and this module
calls them.

**The vendor is probed, not read off the operating system.** `npu` used to map
one backend to each host, which said `platform.system()` names the silicon
vendor. It does not: on Windows the NPU is Intel's, AMD's XDNA or a Snapdragon's
Hexagon, and the one-entry table told all three they had an *Intel NPU* --- so a
Ryzen AI owner was refused with the words "no Intel NPU" on a machine that has
an NPU. A host now maps to an ordered list of candidates (`NPU_CANDIDATES`,
ordered by `npu_candidates`), each ending in a real probe, and a refusal carries
what `_pcivendor` found in the machine --- or says plainly that it could not
look, which is a different sentence. `docs/devices/NPUVENDOR.md` is that round,
including the source trace for why OpenVINO cannot reach an AMD NPU.

**The place that used to disagree with its own probe, and no longer does.**
`torch._C._mps_is_available()` was not a probe --- `bootstrap.py` installed it
as `_constant_function(..., False)`, justified by a comment saying candle's
`metal` feature was off in `Cargo.toml`. That comment was stale: `Cargo.toml`
enables `metal` for Apple targets, and on this host `torch.empty(2, 2,
device="mps")` succeeds and `a + a` on an `mps` tensor returns the right
numbers. So the constant was a **false negative**, and reporting it as
availability would have said "no Metal" on a machine that was computing on
Metal.

That constant is gone (`docs/numerics/DTYPEDEV.md` section 2).
`torch._C._mps_is_available()` now resolves an `mps` device and reports whether
that succeeded, and `torch._C._has_mps` is `cfg!(target_vendor = "apple")` ---
two names for two different questions, which is what upstream's own docstrings
say they are.

**`mps.availability()` is unchanged, and that is the point of it.** It still
reports `kind="measured"` from an actual allocation and still carries the
constant alongside as `detail["declared"]` with `detail["declared_disagrees"]`
--- which is now `False` on this host, because the two agree. Nothing here was
rewritten to depend on them agreeing: a probe that trusted the declared value
would be a probe that could go stale again the same way, and the field exists
precisely so that the next disagreement is visible rather than inferred. See
`docs/devices/DEVICE_NS.md` section 3.
