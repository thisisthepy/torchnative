# Regenerates the checked-in SPIR-V beside each `.comp`.
#
# The words are checked in and `vulkan.rs` `include_bytes!`s them, rather than a
# `build.rs` compiling them. That is deliberate: `torch_c` builds for Android,
# iOS and the host, and a build script that shells out to `glslc` would make all
# three depend on a shader compiler being present for a file that changes about
# once a round. Checking the words in keeps `cargo build --release` exactly what
# `scripts/vendor/install_shim.sh` already runs, on a machine with no Vulkan toolchain.
#
# The cost is that an edit to a `.comp` does nothing until this is run. The
# guard against that is in the test suite, not in the build: it asserts the
# `.spv` is newer than its `.comp`.
#
# glslc comes from the NDK's shader-tools; override with GLSLC.
