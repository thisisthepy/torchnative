//! Per-target link wiring that cannot live in `.cargo/config.toml`.
//!
//! RUST_CROSSBUILD.md §0.5 records that iOS is the one target whose link line
//! needs a *path* -- `-F <dir containing Python.framework>` -- and that this
//! path was hardcoded to one machine in the committed `.cargo/config.toml`.
//! Cargo does no environment expansion inside `rustflags`, so the fix cannot be
//! a variable in that file; it has to be a build script, which is also what the
//! same document calls "`Cargo.kt` 가 주입해야 할 값".
//!
//! The contract is therefore:
//!
//! | variable | who sets it | when |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `BRAINWAVE_PYTHON_FRAMEWORK_DIR` | the build driver (`Cargo.kt`, or the dev shell) | iOS targets only |
//! | `PYO3_CONFIG_FILE` | same, with `suppress_build_script_link_lines=true` | iOS targets only |
//!
//! Both are needed together and neither is sufficient alone -- PyO3 hardcodes
//! iOS as "links libpython" regardless of the `extension-module` feature, so it
//! keeps emitting `-lpython3.13` for a library that does not exist in the iOS
//! distribution until it is suppressed. §0.5 measured both halves.
//!
//! Missing wiring fails here with a message rather than at link time with
//! `library 'python3.13' not found`, which is what the hardcoded path produced
//! on any machine that was not this one.
