//! Block quantisation -- candle's `QTensor`, seen from Python.
//!
//! **Why this is a module and not eight more ops in `aten.rs`.** There is no
//! aten operator this implements. Upstream's quantisation surface
//! (`torch.quantize_per_tensor`, `aten::_int_mm`, `aten::_weight_int8pack_mm`,
//! `aten::_dyn_quant_matmul_4bit`) names per-tensor-affine `int8` and KleidiAI
//! 4-bit packs, and docs/DTYPE.md §6.1 measured what the non-KleidiAI half of
//! that actually is: the pack casts every `uint8` nibble to `float32` and
//! concatenates, so it *grows* the weight. Wearing those names over a GGML
//! k-quant would be claiming a contract this does not honour. So the entrances
//! carry a leading underscore and no aten name, exactly as `_tensor_from_flat`
//! does, and docs/QUANT2.md §7 records what it would take to earn the names.
//!
//! **What this buys and what it does not.** It replaces a leaf -- one
//! `nn.Linear` at a time, from Python, at run time. It does not fuse, does not
//! see a graph, and cannot reach anything a module boundary hides. That
//! ceiling is structural and is the reason docs/DECOMP.md's path is not made
//! redundant by this one.
//!
//! The verification axis is docs/QUANT2.md §2 and it is not a tolerance: the
//! Q8_0 and Q4_0 quantisers are reimplemented from the format in
//! `pytests/ggml_ref.py` and the blob compared **byte for byte**, and the
//! dequantiser is reimplemented for those two plus Q4K and the reconstruction
//! compared **bit for bit** as `float32`. What is left to a bound is only the
//! part that is genuinely lossy, and that bound has a floor as well as a
//! ceiling so that "no quantisation happened" fails it.
