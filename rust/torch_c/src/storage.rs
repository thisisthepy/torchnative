//! `torch._C.StorageBase` -- a flat, untyped byte buffer.
//!
//! The vendored tree's `torch/storage.py:467` opens with
//! `class UntypedStorage(torch._C.StorageBase, _StorageBase)`, so this is the
//! exact name the Python layer subclasses, the same relationship `TensorBase`
//! has with `torch.Tensor`. It is in Rust rather than in `bootstrap.py` for the
//! reason that file's docstring gives: it holds state and enforces an
//! invariant, and bootstrap.py holds neither.
//!
//! # What a storage is here, and what it is not
//!
//! Upstream a storage is the *owner* of a tensor's memory, and a tensor is a
//! view onto it -- `set_` makes the tensor alias the storage, so writing to the
//! storage afterwards changes the tensor. candle owns its own storage and has
//! no way to express that aliasing, so here a storage is a byte buffer that
//! `TensorBase.set_` **copies out of**.
//!
//! That difference is not cosmetic, and docs/CKPT.md §4 has the measurement:
//! `torch.load`'s two container formats fill the storage at different moments
//! relative to `set_`.
//!
//! ```text
//!   zip    (default)  fill storage from the record  ->  _rebuild_tensor -> set_
//!   legacy (v0)       _rebuild_tensor -> set_       ->  fill storage from file
//! ```
//!
//! Under aliasing both orders give the same answer, which is why upstream can
//! use one code path for both. Under copying the second order gives a tensor
//! full of whatever the storage held at `set_` time -- **zeros**. Measured: a
//! copying `set_` loads a legacy checkpoint to a complete state dict in which
//! every single weight is `0.0`, with no error raised anywhere.
//!
//! Silently wrong weights are the worst failure this shim can have, so the
//! ordering is not left to be respected by convention. `filled` records whether
//! any bytes were ever written in, and `set_` refuses on a storage that was
//! never filled. That makes the legacy order impossible to take by accident:
//! anyone who later implements `_set_from_file` gets a refusal naming this
//! invariant instead of a checkpoint of zeros.
//!
//! Note the shape of that invariant, because `from_file` below is the second
//! thing that may set it: `filled` is not "one function may set this", it is
//! **"only something that actually delivered bytes may set this"**. `_shim_fill`
//! takes a buffer, `from_file` reads a file; a plain allocation sets nothing.
//!
//! # `from_file` and why a copy is the right answer
//!
//! `torch.load(mmap=True)` and safetensors' default backend both arrive at
//! `UntypedStorage.from_file(path, shared, nbytes)`, and both pass
//! `shared=False`, because `torch.serialization.get_default_mmap_options()` is
//! `mmap.MAP_PRIVATE`. A private mapping is copy-on-write: measured on upstream
//! 2.13.0, writing through one does not change the file, and a second mapping
//! of the same file does not see the write. Its observable contents are exactly
//! the file's bytes. So reading those bytes into a buffer is not an
//! approximation of `shared=False` -- it is the same object, differing only in
//! residency (eager and whole, rather than lazy and per page) and in
//! `_get_filename()`, which upstream itself answers `None` for `shared=False`.
//!
//! `shared=True` is a different request and is refused by name. It means
//! `MAP_SHARED`: writes must reach the file and other processes. A copy cannot
//! do that, and quietly handing one back would be the same class of failure as
//! the zeros above -- an answer that looks right until someone writes.
//!
//! Slices are real views. `torch/serialization.py:2115` cuts one storage per
//! tensor out of the whole-file storage, so making each slice a copy would
//! double the checkpoint in memory and, worse, would make `data_ptr()` --
//! which upstream's loader uses to tell storages apart -- unrelated to where
//! the bytes actually live. The buffer is behind an `Arc` and a view holds an
//! offset into it, which is what a mapping's slice is.
