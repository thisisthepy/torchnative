//! `torch._C.device`.
//!
//! Deliberately *not* a wrapper around `candle_core::Device`. In torch,
//! `torch.device("cuda")` is constructible on a CPU-only build -- it is a label,
//! and only using it fails. candle's `Device` is the opposite: the enum variant
//! carries a live handle, so it cannot represent a device this build has no
//! backend for. Storing the label and resolving it on use keeps torch's
//! semantics and makes the failure land where torch puts it.
//!
//! docs/DEVICE_ABS.md §3 is where that decision was re-examined once there was
//! something to measure it against. Two things came out of it and live here:
//!
//! *The label is validated.* A label that accepts any string is not a label,
//! it is a free-form note -- `torch.device("cuad")` used to construct fine and
//! then fail at `resolve()` with a message naming a device type nobody asked
//! for. Upstream rejects at construction against a closed list of device
//! types, and that list is the vocabulary `torch.distributed`'s backend
//! registration keys off, so it has to be the same list.
//!
//! *The label is the authority on the index; candle is not.* `from_candle`
//! below reconstructs a label from a live handle, and that direction is lossy:
//! candle's `Cuda`/`Metal` variants do not surface an ordinal through the API
//! this crate builds against, so the reconstruction hardcodes 0. That is sound
//! only while every device kind this build can produce has exactly one device.
//! It is true today (CPU only) and it stops being true the moment a second
//! accelerator of the same kind is addressable -- at which point `PyTensorBase`
//! has to carry the label the way it already carries `tag` for dtype. See
//! docs/DEVICE_ABS.md §3.2.
