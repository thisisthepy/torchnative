//! The name is not arbitrary. The vendored Python tree's `torch/_tensor.py`
//! opens with `class Tensor(torch._C.TensorBase)`, and `torch._tensor` is one of
//! the ten modules IMPORT_WALLS §5 measured as actually executing during

    ///      `torch.conv2d` over `aten.convolution.default`, and not the kind of
    ///      invention `sqrt`-as-`pow(x, 0.5)` would have been.
    ///   2. **The forms are distinguishable at the type level**, which is
    ///      exactly what the old refusal already did -- it extracted a
    ///      `TensorBase` and refused everything else. Nothing here has to guess.
    ///   3. **It costs a family of architectures, not one.**
    ///      `nn.Parameter(torch.Tensor(config.hidden_size).uniform_())` is the
    ///      `masked_spec_embed` idiom, and it is created *unconditionally* in
    ///      `__init__` whether or not `apply_spec_augment` is set -- so no toy
    ///      config avoids it. `sew_d` is the architecture ARCH26.md §4 found it
    ///      in; `wav2vec2`, `sew`, `hubert`, `unispeech` and `wavlm` share the
    ///      line.
    ///
    /// **The bytes are zeros, and upstream's are uninitialised.** That is a
    /// real divergence and it is the same one `aten.empty.memory_format`
    /// already has (its golden case is `_dtype_shape_only_check`, whose whole

    /// narrowing of undefined behaviour rather than a disagreement about a
    /// defined one -- and the real caller writes it immediately, with
    /// `.uniform_()`.
    ///
    /// **The sequence form stays refused.** `torch.Tensor([3, 4])` builds from

// and `max_all` are all public, and all five funnel into
// `Tensor::reduce_impl(.., ReduceOp::Max)`, which is `cpu_backend::ReduceIndex`
// -- the *index-tracking* reduction that `argmax` also uses. Its inner loop is
//
//     for (src_i, &s) in src.iter().enumerate() {
//         if f(val, s) { acc = src_i; val = s }
//     }
//
// a data-dependent compare-and-select with a loop-carried dependency on `val`,
// one element at a time. `ReduceSum` next to it in the same file gets a
// vectorised path; this one does not. docs/numerics/SEQLEN.md §4.3 measured the
// consequence: at `[1, 9, 512, 512]` `float32`, candle's max over the last
// dimension takes 5.69 ms against upstream's 0.099 ms `amax` -- 57x -- and it
// was 24.3% of a `float32` prefill's main thread.
//
// So this is the second of the three routes docs/numerics/SEQLEN.md §5 left open. There
// is **no** public candle API that returns a maximum without the index (route
// one), and forking candle (route three) is not needed: `CustomOp1` +
// `Tensor::apply_op1_no_bwd` are `pub`, they hand a kernel the storage *and*
// the layout, and they are the same mechanism `WriteThrough` above already
// uses for in-place writes (docs/kernels/VIEWS.md §6.2). No `unsafe`, no fork.
//
// **The reduction is not the same function candle computes**, and the one place
// it differs is NaN. candle's predicate is `|x, y| x < y` -- "replace the
// accumulator when it is smaller than the candidate" -- and every comparison
// against a NaN is false, so a NaN that is not the *first* element is silently
// skipped. `max([3, nan, 1])` comes back `3.0` there, where upstream answers
// `nan` (docs/models/E2E_REAL.md; `aten.max.default` already works around it with a
// separate `x != x` pass, and `max.other` had the same fault in its second
// operand, docs/bindings/SPELLINGS.md). This kernel propagates, which is upstream's rule

// gap at `S=1024`, which is 8% of the SDPA gap and 7% of the model gap.
//
// The reason it is slow is candle's `copy_strided_src`, which walks a
// transposed layout **one element at a time**: for each output element it
// recomputes a multi-dimensional index and reads a source address `head_dim`
// floats away from the last one. Every read is a cache miss once the source is
// bigger than L2.
//
// **This is the only entry in §8.12's table that is bit-identical by
// construction**, and that is why it is the one taken. There is no arithmetic
// here at all -- every output element is a *copy* of exactly one input element,
// so there is no summation order to reassociate and no rounding to move. The
// only thing a blocked traversal changes is the order in which the same
// assignments happen.
//
// Contrast with the trap recorded beside it in §8.5: simply *dropping* the
// `contiguous` is 5% faster and **moves the S=6 digest**, because it lets
// Accelerate take a transposed GEMM with a different accumulation order. That
// was tried and rejected. This makes the copy faster; it does not remove it.
