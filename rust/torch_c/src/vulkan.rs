//! The `vulkan` device: a tensor representation that lives outside candle.
//!
//! `docs/devices/VULKAN2.md` §5 sized this and deliberately wrote no code. Its finding
//! is the shape of this file: `candle_core::Device` is a closed enum with
//! nowhere to put a Vulkan handle, so a Vulkan tensor **cannot be a
//! `candle::Tensor` wearing a label**. It has to be a fourth arm of
//! `tensor::Repr`, exactly as `Repr::Quantized` is a third arm for the same
//! structural reason (candle's `QTensor` is a separate type system).
//!
//! **That inheritance is the single most important property here and it must
//! not be weakened.** `PyTensorBase::tensor()` refuses on every non-`Dense`
//! arm, and there are 396 call sites of it in this crate. So a kernel that has
//! not been taught the Vulkan arm *cannot* read CPU storage off a Vulkan
//! tensor by forgetting to check -- it gets a `PyResult` it has to handle, and
//! the only thing it can do with it is raise. **A silent CPU fallback is
//! structurally impossible**, which is what `docs/devices/VULKAN.md` §5 names as the
//! worst available outcome. Ops opt in one at a time, by name, in `dispatch`
//! below; everything else refuses *naming the op*.
//!
//! What is deliberately not here:
//!
//! * **No performance claim of any kind.** The only Vulkan driver reachable on
//!   this machine is `kosmickrisp`, a Vulkan-on-Metal translation layer, so a
//!   number measured here would describe the translator. `docs/devices/VULKAN2.md` §4.4
//!   says so and nothing in this file or its tests times anything.
//! * **No fallback.** If the loader is absent, `ones(..., device="vulkan")`
//!   raises with the loader's own error text. It never quietly returns a CPU
//!   tensor.
//! * **f32 only, contiguous only, same-shape only.** Every other case refuses
//!   by name rather than being approximated.
//!
//! ## Where the loader comes from
//!
//! The loader is *dlopened* rather than linked, so this module compiles and the
//! artefact loads on a machine with no Vulkan at all -- absence is a value that
//! gets reported, not a link error. `loader_candidates_for` lists where it is
//! looked for; on macOS that includes the Homebrew prefixes, where
//! `vulkan-loader` + `molten-vk` put it (docs/devices/VULKAN5.md §1).
//! On this host the loader and ICDs also exist inside the Android emulator's
//! bundle (`docs/devices/VULKAN2.md` §4), and pointing `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` and
//! `VK_DRIVER_FILES` at `libkosmickrisp_icd.json` gives the real `Apple M1`
//! GPU. **Those files are the Android SDK's private implementation detail and
//! this is a development/test path, never a shipping one.**
