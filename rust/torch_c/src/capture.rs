//! Graph capture at the single door.
//!
//! DESIGN.md §11.1 named the problem this is the first piece of: an NPU is not
//! an eager device. ANE, NNAPI and QNN do not take one op at a time -- they
//! take a whole graph, compile it ahead of execution, and run it. Porting
//! kernels one at a time never reaches them, however many kernels are ported.
//! What reaches them is handing a *region* of the program over at once.
//!
//! The same paragraph named why this shim is in an unusually good position to
//! do that: **every op goes through `_aten_dispatch`.** Upstream has to trace
//! with `__torch_dispatch__` modes, `torch.export`'s fake-tensor machinery and
//! a dynamo frame evaluator because upstream's dispatcher has many doors.
//! Here there is one, so the recorder is one branch at one line, and no kernel
//! can escape it by being written later.
//!
//! What this module is:
//!
//! | | |
//! |---|---|
//! | record | ops in order, with the shape/dtype/device of every operand and result |
//! | guard | the conditions under which the record may be replayed at all |
//! | replay | run the record with new inputs and get eager's answer |
//!
//! What it is deliberately not, and refuses by name rather than approximating
//! (docs/CAPTURE.md §4): control flow, in-place mutation, dynamic shapes, and
//! randomness. §6 of DESIGN.md is the rule being followed -- a refusal that
//! says its own name is worth more than a silent wrong answer, and a capture
//! layer is a place where silent wrong answers are *cheap to produce*, because
//! the replayed graph looks exactly as plausible as a correct one.
//!
//! **Recording is an observation, and an observation must not change what it
//! observes.** So an unsupported op does not raise where it happens: it
//! poisons the recording with a reason and lets the program run to completion
//! on the eager path it was already on. The refusal arrives at
//! `_capture_end`, which is where the *claim* of a capture is made.
