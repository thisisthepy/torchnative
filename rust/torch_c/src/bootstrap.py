"""Build the `torch._C` *name* surface, at `_C` import time, inside the `.so`.

Read docs/IMPORT_TORCH.md first; this is the file that document describes.

Why this file exists
--------------------
VENDOR.md measured what the vendored Python tree demands of `_C` before
`import torch` finishes: 989 names, 27-32 C submodules that are themselves
packages, a 694-member `TensorBase`, a 985-member `_VariableFunctions`, and
74 enum instances written into the `torch` module rather than into `_C`.
None of that is computation. It is names, types, and metaclasses -- built
dynamically, once, at import.

Doing it here rather than in Rust is a mechanical choice, not an
architectural one: the operations are identical either way (create a heap
type, set an attribute, insert into `sys.modules`), Rust would spell them
through `Bound<'_, PyAny>` at several times the length, and it would still
run at exactly this moment. `_C` remains one native extension module -- this
file is compiled into it with `include_str!` and executed by
`run_bootstrap` in `lib.rs`.

Everything with *behaviour* stays in Rust: dtype, device, TensorBase, and
the aten dispatcher. Nothing here computes. Every callable it creates either
routes into `_C._aten_dispatch` -- the single door DESIGN.md §6 depends on --
or raises `NotImplementedError` naming itself.

The three rules
---------------
1. **No module-level `__getattr__` on `_C`.** The vendored tree turns whole
   subsystems off by asking `hasattr(torch._C, "_c10d_init")`
   (VENDOR.md wall 11). A catch-all would answer yes to every one of those
   and switch on distributed, RPC, CUDA, XPU, MTIA and MPS at once. A name is
   present here only if the surface table has it and the tree does not merely
   *probe* for it.

2. **Types and submodules do get a catch-all**, because the stubs are
   incomplete for them (`_special`, `_fft` and `_linalg` have no stub at all)
   and because nothing gates on a *member* of a `_C` type the way it gates on
   a name in `_C`. The catch-all hands back an object that raises when used.

3. **Anything not implemented names itself.** DESIGN.md §6 -- the shim is its
   own instrument, so running the tree produces the work queue.

Where the names come from
-------------------------
`vendor/gen_surface.py`, from `torchnative/src/main/torch/_C/*.pyi` -- the vendored tree's
own stubs. Not from an installed upstream `_C.so`. The distinction matters:
the stubs are the tree's statement of what it expects, they ship under the
same BSD licence as the rest of the vendored tree, and using them keeps the
build from needing real torch present.

# where this shim has always stopped, naming itself). That is not going to
# change from inside `bootstrap.py`.
#
# Upstream already has an off switch for exactly this: `PYTORCH_JIT=0` (read
# once by `torch/jit/_state.py:EnabledProxy.__init__`, unmodified in the
# vendored tree). With it set, `torch.jit.script(obj)` and
# `torch.jit.script_method(fn)` both take their own `if not _enabled: return
# obj` branch and hand back the original Python function, unscripted --
# upstream's own documented fallback, not a behaviour invented here. A
# `@torch.jit.script` at module scope (`transformers/models/gpt_bigcode/
# modeling_gpt_bigcode.py:54`, and five other modeling files -- see
# docs/TORCHSCRIPT.md §5) then imports as a plain function instead of running
# a compiler frontend that is not built.
#
# `setdefault`, not an unconditional set: a caller who explicitly asks for
# `PYTORCH_JIT=1` still gets the real (and here, `NotImplementedError`-naming)
# path -- this only changes the answer nobody supplied. Must run before
# `torch.jit._state` is first imported, which happens during `import torch`
# itself (`torch/__init__.py` imports `torch.jit` after `from torch._C import
# *`); `_C`'s own import is what runs this file, so the ordering holds without
# needing a hook anywhere else.

#
# VENDOR.md wall 11, generalised. Each of these is a name the vendored tree
# probes with `hasattr(torch._C, ...)` in order to decide whether a subsystem
# exists. Leaving the name out is the off-switch upstream itself provides, and
# it is the only one it provides -- there is no module-level flag. The list was
# produced by grepping the vendored tree for those probes, so every entry is a
# switch that is really wired, not a guess about what might be optional.
#
# This is not the same as "not implemented". A name that is merely unbuilt
# still appears, and raises when used. A name in this set must *not* appear,
# because its absence is the answer to a question the tree asks.
# `vendor/gen_surface.py` derives the real list by scanning the tree for
# `hasattr(torch._C, "...")` and `getattr(torch._C, "...", ...)`; it arrives in
# the surface under "probes", and `install` reads it from there. Deriving it
# beats hand-listing: the hand-written version this replaced was already
# missing `_cuda_isInBadFork`, `_mps_is_in_bad_fork` and `_xpu_isInBadFork`.
#
# These are the ones a scan cannot see.

# Probes the scan finds but that this shim answers YES to.
#
# `gen_surface.py` derives the off-switch list by scanning the tree for
# `hasattr(torch._C, "...")`, so every subsystem the tree can be asked about
# lands in "probes" whether or not it is built here. That is the right default
# -- absence is how upstream says "not built" -- but it means a subsystem that
# *does* get built has to be taken back out by name, here, rather than by the
# surface generator guessing.
#
# `_c10d_init` is the switch for `torch.distributed`
# (`torch/distributed/__init__.py:28`). docs/DISTRIBUTED.md is what it costs and
# what it buys; `_install_distributed_c10d` is the implementation. Answering it
# is not free: with it off, `torch.distributed` is a five-line stub, and with it
# on the tree walks straight into `_C._distributed_c10d` while `import torch`
# is still running (`torch/utils/data/dataloader.py:26` pulls it in), so the
# subsystem has to be complete enough to finish that import before this line
# can be true.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The vendored tree carries `torchgen/packaged/ATen/native/native_functions.yaml`
# -- 2584 `- func:` lines, each an aten schema, shipped in the wheel as a data
# file (pyproject.toml) and already read at runtime for the Core ATen tag set
# (`torchnative/export/decompose.py`, docs/DECOMP.md §2). It is the source of
# the schema text: it is upstream's own file rather than a transcription, and it
# needs no upstream torch, which a wheel does not have.
#
# It is not *quite* what upstream prints, though. `str(FunctionSchema)` is a C++
# printer working from parsed IValues, and it renormalises the defaults on the
# way out. Measured over all 2584 entries against torch 2.13.0's
# `_jit_get_all_schemas()`, 165 differ, in exactly five ways -- and after the
# five rules below the residual is 0/2584. Each rule states what it reproduces:
#
#   1. `DeviceIndex` is spelled `int` in the printed schema.
#   2. `float`-typed defaults go through C++'s double printer (rule 4), always;
#      `Scalar`-typed ones only when the literal is written as a float, since a
#      `Scalar` default of `1` is an int IValue and prints as `1`.
#   3. String defaults print double-quoted with `'`, `"` and `\` escaped.
#   4. Sized-list defaults broadcast: `SymInt[2] stride=1` -> `[1, 1]`. `int[N]`
#      is the exception and it is upstream's own: its printer re-collapses a
#      uniform `int` list of length > 1 back to the scalar, with the comment
#      "we want to faithfully replicate the schema string". So `int[2]
#      padding=0` stays `0` while `int[1] padding=0` (length 1, so the collapse
#      does not apply) prints `[0]`. Both spellings occur; 101 arguments across
#      the file split along exactly that line.
#   5. Enum-valued defaults print as their integer.
#
# What this is not: it is not a schema *parser* for the tree to use. The parsing
# is `_Schema.parse`'s, unchanged. This only fixes the spelling of defaults so
# that `str(op._schema)` is upstream's string, which is what `verify_schemas.py`
# now diffs.

    work and a refusal after it -- neither is upstream's answer, and the

    the TorchScript numeric builtins), and refusing on "absent from the file"
    stops `import torch` on line 2395. What the file *is* complete for is the
    in-place variant of an op it declares: `add_` sits beside `add`, `relu_`
    beside `relu`. Measured on 2.13.0 -- of the 1348 names of the form
    `<yaml base>_` that the file does not declare, upstream has zero, and of

    Three of these rules are torch's and would be got wrong by intuition:

      * `bool` does **not** satisfy `int`. `bool` subclasses `int` in Python,

        -- `torch.full((2,), True)` must reach `Scalar` as a bool so the result
        is `torch.bool` and not `int64`.
      * `int` **does** satisfy `float`, one way only.
      * a zero-dim tensor satisfies `Scalar`. torch's `DOUBLE`/`SCALAR` case
        falls through to accepting a 0-dim `THPVariable`, which is why
        `torch.pow(t, other_0d_tensor)` picks `pow.Tensor_Tensor` -- declared

    # a few lines away, on the same call shape). Neither is a hook
    # registration like the first two -- both are a **get-and-set**, and the
    # caller relies on the return value to restore the prior state, so unlike
    # the two above these cannot be unconditional `None`-returning no-ops:

    `aten::chunk` is `CompositeImplicitAutograd`: it never reaches a kernel,
    it picks between two ops that do. So it is Python-level here for the same
    reason `softmax` is -- a `methods.json` entry would name
    `aten.chunk.default`, a key no dispatcher ever sees. The body is
    `at::native::chunk` (`aten/src/ATen/native/TensorShape.cpp`) line for
    line, including the zero-extent branch, whose comment upstream says what
    it is for: `split` with a split size of 0 would discard the requested
    number of chunks, because an arbitrary number of empty chunks sums to
    zero all the same.

    Measured with a `TorchDispatchMode` logger on torch 2.13.0:

        arange(10).chunk(3)  -> aten.split.Tensor          shapes 4,4,2
        arange(10).chunk(4)  -> aten.split.Tensor          shapes 3,3,3,1

        empty(0).chunk(3)    -> aten.split_with_sizes      shapes 0,0,0  (three, not one)

    The last two are the reason this is the real arithmetic rather than an
    even division: `chunks` is an upper bound on how many pieces come back,
    not a promise, and only the zero-extent case is allowed to return exactly
    `chunks` of them.

    Returns a `tuple`, which is what upstream's `THPVariable_chunk` returns;
    `_aten_dispatch` hands back a `list` from `split`, so the conversion is
    here and is not cosmetic (`a, b = t.chunk(2)` works either way, but

    for a `None`, and one `index.Tensor` at the end if any index was a tensor.
    Measured, on torch 2.13.0:

        f[0]        -> [select.int]
        f[0, 1]     -> [select.int, select.int]
        f[:, 1]     -> [select.int]          (the full slice emits nothing)
        f[0:1]      -> [slice.Tensor]
        f[None]     -> [unsqueeze]
        f[bool_t]   -> [index.Tensor]
        f[[0, 1]]   -> [lift_fresh, index.Tensor]
        f[..., [-2], :] -> [lift_fresh, index.Tensor]

    So this reproduces the walk rather than inventing a single `getitem` op,
    and every step goes through `_aten_dispatch`. What it does *not* do is
    mixed basic-and-advanced indexing: an index containing both a tensor and a
    non-trivial slice is refused by name instead of being approximated.

    `__setitem__` is the same walk read backwards, and the measurements that
    shape it are in its own docstring.

            x[0] = 3.0         -> [lift_fresh, select.int, fill_.Tensor]
            x[0, 1] = 9.0      -> [lift_fresh, select.int, select.int, copy_.default]
            x[1:3] = tensor    -> [slice.Tensor, copy_.default]
            x[1:3] = 5.0       -> [lift_fresh, slice.Tensor, fill_.Tensor]
            x[None] = 0.0      -> [lift_fresh, unsqueeze, fill_.Tensor]
            0-d x[...] = 3.0   -> [lift_fresh, copy_.default]

        **The last five rows are why the choice between `copy_` and `fill_` is
        not "tensor on the right or number on the right".** An earlier reading
        of this table had `x[0] = 3.0` lowering to `copy_`, which is the shape
        the *number/tensor* rule predicts and not what torch does. Upstream's
        rule is in `python_variable_indexing.cpp::copy_to` and it is about
        shapes, so it is reproduced as such below:

            sizes equal            -> copy_
            else source is 0-d     -> fill_
            else                   -> broadcast, then copy_

        `x[0] = 3.0` takes the middle arm ((3,) destination, 0-d source) and a
        0-d destination takes the first, which is why `0-d x[...] = 3.0` is a
        `copy_` while `x[:] = 3.0` on a matrix is a `fill_`.

        **The basic-index write works now, and what changed is not here.**
        `aten.select.int` and `aten.slice.Tensor` (step 1) always aliased
        their input -- candle's `narrow`/`squeeze` clone the storage `Arc` and
        rebuild only the `Layout`. What was missing was the *write*: every
        in-place op swapped the wrapper's tensor for a freshly computed one
        instead of writing into the buffer that wrapper pointed at, so the
        upstream sequence ran to completion and changed nothing. That is now
        `PyTensorBase::write_into` (docs/VIEWS.md §6), and this branch is the
        caller it was built for.

        **Two things still refuse, and neither is a view problem.**

          * A slice with `step != 1`. `slice.Tensor` handles it by
            `index_select`, which *copies* -- measured in docs/VIEWS.md §4,
            `x` and `slice.Tensor(x, 0, 5, 2)` hold independent buffers. So
            the walk would produce something that is not a view of `self`, and
            writing into it would be exactly the silent no-op this branch used
            to exist to prevent.
          * Mixed basic and advanced indexing, unchanged and for the same
            reason as in `__getitem__`.

        A **sequence** index (`x[[0, 2]] = v`) takes the advanced arm, lifted
        by the same `_lift_sequence_index` the read side uses -- the two walks
        have to agree on what an index *is*, or `x[i] = x[i]` would take two
        different routes.

    `TensorBase.requires_grad_` before it reaches anything else interesting, so
    the choice was between stopping there and carrying an inert flag.

    The flag is carried, and the boundary is drawn where it can be seen:

      * `requires_grad` stores and reports what was set. Nothing reads it.
      * `grad_fn` and `grad` are always `None`, which is the truth -- no graph
        node was ever created and no gradient was ever accumulated.
      * `backward()` stays a raising stub, so code that actually depends on
        the flag meaning something fails by name rather than silently getting
        zeros.

    `data` returns `self`, not a detached alias. Upstream's `.data` shares
    storage with the original, so `p.data.normal_()` writes through to `p`;
    returning `self` gives that same write-through with the same object, and
    differs in that our `.data` still reports the original `requires_grad`.
    Recorded in docs/TENSORBASE.md rather than hidden.

# aten schemas that are *generated* rather than declared, and so are in no data

#
# `native_functions.yaml` has 2584 entries and upstream's registry has 3754 aten
# schemas. The difference is `torchgen/native_function_generation.py`, which
# synthesises `.out`, functional and mutable variants at build time from the
# declared ones. That code is vendored, but running it means parsing the YAML
# with `pyyaml`, which is not a dependency of this distribution (the same wall
# `decompose._scan_core_tags` is written around), so the generated half cannot
# be re-derived here.
#
# This is not the whole generated half -- it is the part the tree asks a
# *question* about, measured rather than guessed. With placeholders instrumented,
# a full run (import, the transformers road, FSDP, the decomposition pass) reads
# `is_mutable` or `_is_view_op()` on 102 ops with no text; 84 of those do not
# exist upstream either, and these 18 do. Transcribing them is what makes
# "no operator upstream has is answered from an empty schema" true, and
# `verify_schemas.py` re-derives them from a real torch the same way it does
# `_NON_ATEN_SCHEMA_TEXT`.
#
# One of the 18 is the reason the list is not optional:
# `native_dropout_backward.out` is mutable upstream and a placeholder answers
# False. The other 17 agree with the placeholder's answer today, and are here so
# that "agrees today" is not what the property rests on.

# exactly two answers and both change behaviour -- there is no third,
# placeholder-shaped answer to fall back on. Adding a `_bool` to the stubs and
# not deciding here is now an import-time error naming the flag, rather than a
# truthy object waiting in a branch.
#
# Every value below is `False`, and that is a fact about this build rather than
# a default: candle on the CPU links none of these libraries. Two entries are
# worth their own note --
#
#   `_has_kleidiai`  Upstream on the host that measured this answers *True*
#                    (KleidiAI is ARM's kernel library and an arm64 mac build
#                    picks it up). That is a fact about upstream's build, not
#                    about the API, and copying it would be the same error as

# `torch._C._nn` -- the three names a model path actually calls
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The submodule loop above gives `_nn` all 70 names the stubs declare, every
# one of them a raising stub. docs/NN_SURFACE.md measured which of them a
# 2-layer Llama forward plus greedy `generate` calls, on upstream torch 2.13.0,
# by wrapping each builtin rather than by reading the tree:
#
#     _C._nn.linear                          150 calls
#     _C._nn.scaled_dot_product_attention      10
#     _C._nn.silu                              20
#     ...and nothing else. 3 of 96.
#
# So this is not a port of `_C._nn`; it is the three names, and the other 67
# stay raising stubs on purpose (rule 2 -- a hole, never a switch).
#
# WHY THESE ARE PYTHON-LEVEL COMPOSITIONS AND NOT NEW KERNELS. `aten::linear`
# and `aten::dropout` are `CompositeImplicitAutograd` upstream: they have no
# kernel at all, and what a `TorchDispatchMode` logger sees under
# `F.linear(...)` is `t` + `addmm`/`mm` + `view`, never `aten.linear.default`.
# Reproducing that decomposition here is therefore *following* upstream rather
# than routing around it, and it keeps DESIGN.md §6's single door: every step
# below goes through `_C._aten_dispatch` with a key the golden harness already
# compares against upstream. Nothing here computes.
#
# `scaled_dot_product_attention` is the opposite shape -- upstream picks a
# backend and calls one fused op -- so it is a selection, not a decomposition.

        beside it. So `.vec` belongs here, not in a table, for the reason
        `layer_norm` and `group_norm` give.

        **The scale factors are forwarded, not just used to size the output**,

        `scale_factor=2` test produces -- and diverge as soon as the product is
        not integral. Dropping them here would make `scale_factor=1.5` sample a
        different grid, silently, with the right output shape.

        `scale_factors` may be given -- not "output_size wins", which is what
        this was written as first and what a golden case caught. Upstream
        raises `Must specify exactly one of output_size and scale_factors`, and

        `aten.einsum.default` never fires. So this is a composite for the
        reason `layer_norm`'s note above gives, and -- the part that matters
        numerically -- **the contraction really is a `bmm`**, so the
        accumulation order is upstream's rather than a hand-rolled sum's.

        The algorithm, for one contraction of two operands:

            batch      labels in BOTH inputs and in the output
            summed     labels in BOTH inputs and NOT in the output
            free_a     labels in a only (and in the output)
            free_b     labels in b only (and in the output)

            a -> (batch, free_a, summed) -> (B, M, K)
            b -> (batch, summed, free_b) -> (B, K, N)
            bmm                             (B, M, N)
            -> batch + free_a + free_b   -> permuted to the output order

        A label that appears in one operand only and *not* in the output is
        summed out of that operand first, before the pairing -- otherwise it
        would have to become a spurious free axis.

        More than two operands fold left, which is what `torch/functional.py`
        does too when `opt_einsum` is unavailable.

        **Refused by name, not approximated:**

          * an ellipsis (`...`) -- it stands for a variable number of batch
            axes and needs its own rank arithmetic;
          * a label repeated *within* one operand (`ii->i`) -- that is a
            diagonal, not a contraction, and there is no `diagonal` kernel
            here;
          * the sublist form (`einsum(a, [0, 1], b, [1, 2])`), which is a
            different overload;
          * a non-`None` `path`, which only `opt_einsum` supplies.

        The implicit-output form (no `->`) IS supported, with upstream's rule:
        the output is every label appearing exactly once across all operands,
        in alphabetical order.

        instead of cat()"*. So this is on cohere's rotary path, once per
        forward.

        **Two of upstream's overloads, and only one of them is here.** A
        `TorchDispatchMode` logger on torch 2.13.0:

            repeat_interleave(x, 2, dim=-1)   unsqueeze, expand, clone, view
            repeat_interleave(x, 2)           view, unsqueeze, expand, clone, view
            repeat_interleave(x, tensor, ...) repeat_interleave.Tensor, index_select

        The integer-`repeats` overload (`aten::repeat_interleave.self_int`) is
        `CompositeImplicitAutograd` and emits *no* record of its own -- it is
        the four-op expansion above, every one of which this shim already has.
        The tensor-`repeats` overload is a genuine kernel plus `index_select`,
        neither of which exists here, so it is refused by name rather than
        approximated.

        The expansion, transcribed from the trace rather than invented:

            dim is None:  flatten to 1-D first, then dim = 0
            unsqueeze at dim+1        -> (..., n_dim, 1, ...)
            expand that axis to repeats
            clone (expand is a view; the copy is what materialises the repeat)
            view back with sizes[dim] *= repeats

        Checked against upstream's answers, not just its op sequence:
        `repeat_interleave([[0,1,2],[3,4,5]], 2, dim=1)` is
        `[[0,0,1,1,2,2],[3,3,4,4,5,5]]` and `dim=0` is
        `[[0,1,2],[0,1,2],[3,4,5],[3,4,5]]` -- the two differ, so a wrong
        unsqueeze axis cannot pass both.

        Three refusals copied from upstream's own messages, all measured:
        a negative `repeats`, an out-of-range `dim`, and an `output_size` that
        disagrees with the computed one. `repeats=0` is *not* an error --
        it produces a zero-length axis, and `repeats=1` is the identity.

        this is the name a `nn.Conv1d` actually calls.

        **The kernel was already here.** `aten.convolution.default` has been

        `CompositeImplicitAutograd`; measured with a `TorchDispatchMode` logger
        on 2.13.0, every form of the call fires exactly one record:

            conv1d(x, w, b, 1, 2, 1, 4)  -> convolution(x, w, b, [1], [2], [1],

        so the whole of the composite is filling in `transposed=False` and
        `output_padding=[0]`, the two arguments `conv1d` does not have and
        `convolution` requires.

        Scalars widen to one-element lists because `convolution`'s schema takes
        `SymInt[]` for all three, and the trace shows upstream passing `[1]`
        where the caller wrote `1`.

        `padding` accepts upstream's two string spellings as well as a number.
        `"valid"` is zero. `"same"` is `dilation * (kernel - 1) // 2`, which is
        only the whole answer when that product is *even* -- upstream pads the
        input asymmetrically when it is odd, and that path is refused by name
        here rather than rounded, since rounding it would silently shift the
        output by one sample. Measured: `padding="same"` with a 3-tap kernel
        and dilation 1 reaches `convolution(..., [1], ...)`, which is the even
        case. Non-unit stride with `"same"` is upstream's own refusal.

        widening below mostly serves a caller that spells `F.conv2d` directly

        convenience added here.

        `padding="same"`/`"valid"` follow `conv1d`'s rule component-wise: each

        registry entries here against upstream's 1097, and 525 of ours ended in
        `.default` against upstream's 456.

        Three sources, unioned, because no one of them is complete:

        1. `native_functions.yaml`, which is authoritative for the 1554 aten

        Falling back to `["default"]` when all three are silent keeps the
        registry open (docs/SCHEMA.md §12): a name nobody has declared still
        yields a callable, and `_aten_dispatch` refuses it at call time with

    enabled:`, and `modeling_llama.py:121` wraps the rotary embedding in it --
    so this name is the first thing a real `LlamaForCausalLM` forward pass
    asks for, and docs/DISTRIBUTED.md §7 named it as the wall that round
    stopped at.

    **The read is not a constant; the write is a refusal, and that is the
    argument for the read.** Autocast is a dispatch key: when it is on,
    upstream intercepts each op and casts its inputs to a lower precision
    before the kernel sees them. There is no such key here and no kernel casts
    anything, so a `True` from this predicate would mean every op in the block
    ran in `float32` while the caller believed it ran in `bfloat16` --
    right-shaped numbers, wrong ones. So:

      * `is_autocast_enabled(device_type)` reads a real per-device flag,
      * `set_autocast_enabled(device_type, True)` refuses by name,
      * `set_autocast_enabled(device_type, False)` is accepted, because it is
        already true and a caller restoring the previous state (which is what
        `torch.autocast.__exit__` does) must not fail.

    The flag can therefore never be raised, which is what makes the read
    derived rather than asserted -- the same shape as the functorch dynamic
    layer stack in `_install_repr_surface`, and the test that pins it is
    `test_autocast_is_off_and_cannot_be_turned_on`.

    `get_autocast_dtype` answers upstream's per-device *default*, which is a
    real value even when autocast is off: `torch._C.get_autocast_dtype("cpu")`
    is `torch.bfloat16` on 2.13.0 with no autocast block anywhere, measured.
    Reporting it enables nothing -- nothing consults it while the flag is down
    -- and answering `float32` instead would have been a made-up number that
    happens to describe what the kernels do.

    docs/DEVICE_ABS.md is the measurement this was built from; §2 is the table

    is that the *label* worked and everything that consumed a label did not:
    `nn.Module.to("cpu")`, `Module.cpu()`, `Module.float()` and every
    `Module._apply` were dead on `torch._C._nn._parse_to` and
    `torch._has_compatible_shallow_copy_type`, which is the whole road a
    checkpoint travels.

    Nothing here reaches the aten dispatcher, and that is measured rather than
    assumed. Run inside a `TorchDispatchMode` on torch 2.13.0, `x.cpu()`,
    `x.to("cpu")`, `x.get_device()`, `x.is_floating_point()`, `x.is_complex()`,
    `m.to("cpu")`, `m.cpu()` and `Generator.device` each record **zero**
    dispatcher calls -- they read metadata off the TensorImpl. Only a `.to()`
    that actually changes something records one, and that is
    `aten._to_copy.default`, which already has a kernel and golden cases. So
    these are not a second door into the dispatcher (DESIGN.md §6); they are
    the same nine-names-that-never-dispatch family `tools/golden/cases.py`
    already documents, and they need no case builders for the same reason
    `device`, `dim` and `dtype` need none.

def _install_distributed_c10d(module, spec) -> None:
    """`torch._C._distributed_c10d`, at world_size 1.

    docs/DISTRIBUTED.md. This subsystem was **off**: `_c10d_init` was one of the
    names in the "Deliberate omissions" set at the top of this file, because
    `torch/distributed/__init__.py:28` is `hasattr(torch._C, "_c10d_init")` and
    absence is the switch upstream provides. Turning it on is not a one-line
    change, and docs/SURFACE_HONESTY.md §2.4 is the measurement that says why:
    an instrument that answered *every* attribute still could not finish
    `import torch`, because `distributed_c10d.py:547` walks
    `ReduceOp.RedOpType.__members__` and `distributed_c10d.py:321` reads
    `ProcessGroup.BackendType.UNDEFINED`. What the tree wants here is structure,
    not names -- real enums, nested types, subclassable bases -- so the generic
    submodule builder above cannot produce it and this replaces its output.

    **What is real and what is refused.** At world_size 1 a great deal of this
    is not a stand-in for anything:

      * The **store** is a genuine key/value store. "Distributed store" and
        "local dict" are the same object when this process is the only writer,
        so `Store`/`HashStore`/`PrefixStore` here are implementations, not
        placeholders. `Store.wait` is the one that has to be careful: at
        world_size 1 an absent key is not "not yet", it is "never", so it
        raises rather than blocking or returning.
      * **Work** is always complete, because every collective a single rank can
        perform finishes before the call returns. There is nothing to wait for
        and saying so is accurate.
      * `TCPStore` **refuses by name**. There is no peer at the other end of
        that socket, and a store that silently behaved like a local dict while
        claiming to be a rendezvous point is exactly the failure docs/CKPT.md
        recorded -- it looks like it worked.
      * `ProcessGroupGloo`/`Nccl`/`Ucc`/`Xccl`/`Mpi` are **absent**, not stubbed.
        `distributed_c10d.py:204-242` imports each in its own
        `try/except ImportError` and sets an availability flag, so absence is
        the answer the tree is written to receive. Providing an empty class
        would set the flag to True and route real collectives into it.

    `_c10d_init` is the tree's own initialisation hook, and this module uses it
    for the one thing that cannot happen at `import torch._C` time -- see
    `_c10d_init` below.

    # collective has one contribution, so:

    #                   a reduction over one element is that element -- and

    #                   process, so the tensor is already what it will be.

        Two things happen here that cannot happen when `_C` is imported.

        The first is the reason this function has a body at all: upstream's
        `ProcessGroup` carries `torch._opaque_base.OpaqueBaseMeta` as its
        metaclass, and `device_mesh._register_distributed_opaque_types`
        refuses anything that does not. `_C` cannot reach into the Python tree
        while `torch/__init__.py` is still running -- and must not, when it is
        loaded standalone as `_C` by the golden harness, where `import torch`
        would pull in a *different* torch. By the time this is called,
        `torch.distributed` is being imported, so the tree is certainly there.

        The shape is `_set_generator_metaclass`'s (VENDOR.md wall 19) with the
        direction reversed: there the tree pushes the metaclass in, here `_C`
        pulls it, because nothing in the tree offers to push this one.

    `torch/random.py:24` is `from torch._C import default_generator` and every
    function in that module is a method call on it, so the name has to exist
    before `import torch` finishes. It has existed all along as an
    `_Unimplemented`; what changes here is that the CPU RNG behind it is real
    (`rng.rs`), so `manual_seed` can mean what it means upstream -- the same
    seed gives the same numbers as torch, bit for bit for `uniform_`.

    It is an *instance of the synthesised `Generator` class*, not a new type,
    for two reasons that both bite:

      * `_TypeChecker._base` answers the schema's `Generator?` parameter with
        `isinstance(value, module.Generator)`, so anything else would fail to
        bind `tensor.uniform_(a, b, generator=torch.default_generator)`.
      * `Generator` has to stay a heap type -- `_set_generator_metaclass`
        reassigns its `__class__` (VENDOR.md wall 19), which a PyO3 static type
        cannot do.

    Three methods are real and the rest keep refusing. `get_state`/`set_state`
    are the notable absence: upstream's is a 5056-byte legacy blob whose layout
    is the MT19937 struct itself (docs/RNG.md §1.1), and exchanging that blob
    with real torch is a separate piece of work from reproducing the stream.
    Left refusing by name rather than given a format of our own, because a
    round-trippable-but-incompatible blob is the kind of thing that looks like
    interop until someone tries it.
