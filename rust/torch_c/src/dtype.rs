//! `torch._C.dtype`.
//!
//! In real PyTorch `torch.float32` is not a Python-level constant -- it is an
//! instance of a type defined in `_C`, and the vendored Python tree re-exports
//! it (`torch/__init__.py`). So the shim has to own the type, not just a name.
//!
//! It also has to own the *set*. This module used to wrap `candle_core::DType`
//! directly, which meant the shim could only name a dtype candle could store:
//! ten of them. The vendored tree needs thirty-three. `torch/_prims_common`,
//! `torch/_tensor_str.py` and `torch/_refs` all build tables over
//! `torch.bool`, `torch.int8`, `torch.complex64` and the quantised types while
//! `import torch` is still running, so a shim with ten dtypes cannot finish the
//! import at all.
//!
//! BOOL.md settled the shape of the answer for `torch.bool` and it generalises
//! to the rest: **`_C` owns the dtype tag and candle owns the storage.** The
//! two are related by `storage()`, which is `None` for every dtype candle
//! cannot hold. That is the same decision `device` already embodies (a label,
//! resolved on use) and it has the same payoff -- the failure lands where torch
//! puts it, by name, instead of on a near neighbour.
//!
//! Specifically *not* done: aliasing `bool` onto `uint8`. BOOL.md §3 measured
//! what that costs -- `bool + bool` is a logical or while `uint8 + uint8` is an
//! arithmetic sum, `~bool` is a logical not while `~uint8` is a bit flip, and
//! `masked_fill` stops refusing the wrong mask dtype. Six of torch's own
//! guardrails are keyed on the tag; sharing one tag between the two turns all
//! six off.

// --- the default floating dtype ---------------------------------------------
//
// `torch.set_default_dtype` / `torch.get_default_dtype`, and the value every
// dtype-inference rule in `aten.rs` and `lib.rs` reads when the caller did not
// name a dtype. This used to be `aten::DEFAULT_FLOAT`, a `const`; docs/
// DISTRIBUTED.md §3.4 refused the setter on the grounds that it would have to
// reach a Rust constant. `transformers` ended that argument --
// `modeling_utils.py:239` calls `torch.set_default_dtype(dtype)` on the way
// into `from_pretrained`, so the const had to become a global.
//
// **Representation: an `AtomicU8` index into `DEFAULT_FLOAT_CHOICES`.** The
// alternatives and why not:
//
//   `RwLock<TorchDType>`   Reads happen on the dispatcher's hottest path -- a
//                          factory call, an integral-to-float promotion -- and
//                          each would pay an atomic read-modify-write plus a
//                          poison check to guard a value that is one byte
//                          wide. A `Relaxed` load of an `AtomicU8` is a plain
//                          byte load.
//   `OnceLock`             Cannot change, which is the entire requirement.
//   `static mut`           Unsound under any concurrent read, and Rust 2024
//                          makes even taking a reference to one an error.
//
// `Relaxed` is the right ordering, not a shortcut: the dtype tag is the whole
// of the payload. Nothing else is being published alongside it, so there is no
// happens-before edge for a stronger ordering to establish. (Upstream's own is
// a plain non-atomic C++ global, so this is if anything stricter.) In practice
// every read and every write here happens under the GIL as well.
//
// The value is an index into `DEFAULT_FLOAT_CHOICES` rather than the enum's
// discriminant so that no `transmute` and no `#[repr(u8)]` is needed, and so
// that the accept set has exactly one spelling: `set_default_dtype` refuses
// anything `position()` cannot find, and `default_float()` can only ever
// return something from that list.
