"""The NPU vendor is resolved by probe, not read off the operating system.

See docs/devices/NPUVENDOR.md.

**What is checkable here and what is not.** This is an arm64 Mac. There is no
Windows, no registry, no Intel NPU, no AMD NPU and no Snapdragon, so *none* of
`_pcivendor`'s registry code can execute. What can be checked is everything that
does not need the hardware, and the split is deliberate:

* The **candidate table and its order** are pure data plus `platform.machine()`,
  and both `TORCHNATIVE_DEVICE_HOST` and `TORCHNATIVE_DEVICE_MACHINE` move, so
  win_amd64 and win_arm64 are both exercised from here. Without the second
  variable an order that ignored the ISA would pass --- it would answer the same
  on this Mac and never be asked anything else.
* The **classifier** is fed registry-shaped dictionaries directly. That is not a
  claim that a real machine produces those dictionaries (NPUVENDOR.md section 6
  says it is unverified); it is a check that *given* the shape Microsoft
  documents, an AMD NPU is recognised as an AMD NPU and not as an absence.
* The **refusal wording** is checked for the sentence a Ryzen AI owner must not
  read. That is the whole defect, so it gets a test that names it.
* The **"could not look" / "looked and found nothing"** distinction is checked
  as two different strings, because collapsing them is the defect with a
  different cause.

Nullifications this file is meant to catch, each verified by making the break
and watching it go red:

* the candidate table reduced to one backend per host -> `test_windows_tries_more_than_one_candidate_in_an_isa_dependent_order`
* the ISA ignored when ordering                        -> same test
* an AMD NPU reported as nothing                       -> `test_an_amd_npu_is_recognised_by_name_and_not_reported_as_an_absence`
* "could not look" rendered as "found nothing"         -> `test_could_not_look_is_a_different_sentence_from_found_nothing`
* the refusal telling an NPU owner they have no NPU    -> `test_the_refusal_never_tells_a_machine_with_an_npu_that_it_has_none`
* the adb probe run on Windows                         -> `test_the_hexagon_candidate_refuses_on_windows_rather_than_probing_over_adb`
* the class-code signal deleted                        -> `test_an_unknown_vendors_accelerator_is_still_caught_by_the_class_code`
