"""A failed cross build must not leave a wheel in `--outdir`.

`tools/wheel/build.py --target <cross>` builds an intermediate wheel with
`pip wheel`, then patches it for the target platform. `global_deps_stub`
(compiling the empty `libtorch_global_deps` stub for the *target*, via
`zig`/`emcc`/`$TARGET_CC`) runs *after* that intermediate wheel exists, so a
missing cross toolchain used to fail there and leave the untouched,
host-tagged intermediate (`...-macosx_11_0_universal2.whl`) sitting in
`--outdir` -- a publishable-looking artefact with the wrong platform tag, from
a build that never finished.

`build.py` now stages the whole pipeline (pip wheel -> repack -> verify) in a
`tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` and moves the result into `--outdir` only after
every step has succeeded. This file reproduces the trap directly: it points
`--target linux-x86_64` at a hand-built, minimally-valid ELF stand-in for the
cross artefact (so the early "no cross-built extension" / staleness / tag
checks all pass) with no `zig`/`$TARGET_CC` available, so the build reaches
`global_deps_stub` and fails there -- exactly the failure this trap needs.

Building the fake ELF rather than a real cross artefact: this machine has no
`zig` and building one for real is exactly what LINUX.md §9 documents as
needing a toolchain this environment does not have. The fake only has to
satisfy `elf_info`/`elf_dynamic` (`ELF 64-bit x86_64 dyn`, one `DT_NEEDED` on
`libc.so.6`, one `GLIBC_2.17` version requirement) -- the same shape
`self_test_linux`'s `_minimal_elf` helper builds elsewhere in this repository,
extended with a `.dynamic`/`.gnu.version_r` pair because `platform_tag` reads
those too.
