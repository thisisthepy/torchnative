"""Complex tensors: the imaginary part survives, and everything else refuses.

`docs/kernels/COMPLEX.md` sized this and left it unstarted because `tensor.rs` was
another round's file; `docs/kernels/COMPLEX2.md` is the round that built it. What
landed is `Repr::Complex { re, im }` -- a *pair* of real candle tensors, not
interleaved storage -- plus twelve ops taught that arm by name.

**The failure this file exists to catch is not a crash.** A complex tensor that
silently loses its imaginary part still returns plausible numbers: right shape,
right dtype, right order of magnitude. It survives a smoke test. So every
positive assertion below is **element-wise against upstream torch**, run in a
separate process, on *both* components -- and the tests that matter most are the
ones that would still pass if `im` were quietly dropped, which is why none of
them is a shape check.

Two things are asserted that are not "does it compute":

1.  **The refusals.** ~400 sites read a tensor's storage through
    `PyTensorBase::tensor()`, which refuses on the complex arm. That is what
    makes dropping the imaginary part unrepresentable rather than merely
    avoided (docs/devices/VULKAN2.md's standard). `test_every_untaught_op_refuses`
    walks a sample of them; nullifying that arm in `tensor.rs` (returning `re`)
    turns it red, which was checked rather than assumed.
2.  **The narrowing.** Upstream's `view_as_complex` genuinely aliases its base;
    a pair copies. `llama4` does not depend on it, but it is written down and
    tested *as a narrowing* rather than left for someone to discover.

Nothing here needs numpy or a network. It does need the vendored shim
(`vendor/install_shim.sh`); without it every probe skips, the same way
`test_tail2.py` skips.

    `docs/kernels/COMPLEX3.md` §8.1 taught five more ops and the list did not follow.

    simply short -- and a refusal naming a list shorter than the truth tells a
    user an op is unavailable when it works, which is the same class of harm as
    naming one that is too long.

    The `strided` round recommended this and declined to write it, because the
    complex round was editing this file at the time and a collision there would
    have cost more than it saved. It also refused to append the six names in
    its own worktree, where the ops genuinely did refuse -- appending there
    would have produced the staleness *inverted*, a list naming ops that raise.
    Both calls were right, and this is the check that makes the next such
    append unnecessary.
