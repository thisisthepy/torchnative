"""docs/numerics/AGREE2.md -- what holds the re-measured agreement counts down.

`agree_sweep.py` is not wired into `run.sh` and must not be: it needs both
interpreters and hours. So the counts AGREE2.md publishes cannot be re-taken by
the gate, and the previous round showed exactly what that costs -- its artefacts
were in `/tmp`, they were gone by the next session, and the state of the
project's strongest claim was not knowable without re-running the whole sweep.

The fix is to store the *per-architecture measurements* rather than the counts,
and re-derive the counts here by calling `agree_sweep.verdict` itself. That
draws the line where it belongs:

  * A change to the RULE that LOWERS agreement -- a deleted refusal branch,
    architectures dropped from the recording -- moves these counts and fails
    this file. A change that WIDENS it does not, and cannot: the markers are
    `ge`/`le` because a later round may legitimately raise the count, so
    ORACLE_FACTOR 4 -> 40 leaves every count assertion green (measured). That
    direction is held by `test_agree.py`'s
    `test_the_oracle_factor_is_stated_and_is_not_a_free_parameter`, and the two
    files are only jointly sufficient -- which is the honest statement, since
    widening a threshold until a flag disappears is exactly what AGENTS.md
    warns about.
  * A change to the TREE -- an operator landing, a kernel regressing -- cannot
    be caught here, and nothing in this file pretends otherwise. Only re-running
    the sweep settles that. `test_the_recording_says_when_it_was_taken` is the
    one honest guard: the measurement carries its own date.

The no-regression invariant is the other thing pinned here, and it is stated
structurally rather than as a list of names: every architecture that diverges
must either be the one `docs/numerics/AGREE.md` already flagged, or one of the
seven that document's §7 listed as unmeasured. Anything else means something
that agreed on 2026-08-24 stopped agreeing, which is the most important thing
this sweep could ever report.

Nothing here needs torch, the network, a checkpoint, or `transformers`.
