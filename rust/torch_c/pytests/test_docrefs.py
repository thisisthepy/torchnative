"""Do the documentation paths this tree writes down still point at documents?

`docs/` was a flat list of 183 files, and roughly six thousand strings across
Markdown prose, Rust comments, Python docstrings, DOCWATCH markers and workflow
files name those files by path. Sorting them into subfolders is only safe if
every one of those strings moves with its target, and a missed one is invisible:
nothing dereferences a path written in a comment.

The specific failure this file was written against is sharper than a broken
link, and it is the shape CLAUDE.md §5.5 records repeatedly -- a check that
cannot fail. `run.sh` fed the documentation checker with a shell glob:

    "$repo_root"/docs/*.md "$repo_root/README.md"

A glob does not recurse. The moment a document moved into `docs/<folder>/` it
would drop out of DOCWATCH silently: the gate stays green, the marker count gets
*smaller*, and nothing says a word. `check_docs.py`'s own default was the same
glob (`DOCS_DIR.glob("*.md")`), which is the more dangerous of the two because
it under-reports for anyone who invokes the checker directly rather than through
the gate. Both are now recursive, and `test_docwatch_enumerates_docs_recursively`
below fails if either reverts.
What this cannot see, stated rather than implied:

  * **Interpolated paths.** `f"docs/platform/RELEASE_{version}.md"` has no literal
    filename, so neither the reference scan nor the split-literal scan can check
    it. Two of these were in `test_release.py` and the gate found them by
    FileNotFoundError, one run apart. If you build a documentation path from a
    variable, the suite that reads it is the only thing that will notice.
  * **References inside the vendored tree** (`torchnative/src/main/torch/`),
    which is upstream's and regenerated.
