"""The runtime wheel harnesses, and the judgement they are only useful for.

`docs/platform/RELEASE_0_1_0b3.md` §6 grades a platform **reaches** when an
interpreter *for that platform* unpacked the published wheel into its own
site-packages and `torch.__file__` came back out of that site-packages. That one
assertion is the whole difference between "a torch answered" and "this wheel's
torch answered" -- a stray `PYTHONPATH`, or a working directory inside the
repository, is enough to make the second false while the first stays true.

Three harnesses now make it: `verify_android.py` on a device, `verify_ios_sim.py`
in a simulator, and `verify_wasm_browser.py` under Pyodide. The first two were
already here; this file exists because the third arrived with two traps the other
two structurally cannot have, and because one shared helper had already silently
blocked all of them.

  * **one interpreter, two modes.** A browser page is not two processes. The
    Android and iOS harnesses run their `bare` and `stubbed` probes as separate
    `python3.13` invocations, so a half-imported `torch` left behind by the first
    cannot be found in `sys.modules` by the second. Under Pyodide both modes run
    in the same interpreter, so the second answer is about the first run unless
    the modules are cleared. A test that only checked "the wasm run passed" would
    not see this: the *stubbed* run is the one the judgement is taken from, and it
    is the one that would be answered from cache.

  * **JSON through JavaScript.** The wasm result crosses a JS runtime, where
    `4.0` and `4` are the same number. `mm == [[4.0, ...]]` therefore stays true
    for a result that is no longer float32, so the dtype has to be carried and
    checked separately.

  * **`pkg_resources`.** `stage_dependencies` mapped the `setuptools` requirement
    to `["setuptools", "pkg_resources"]`, and setuptools stopped shipping
    `pkg_resources` in 82. With 84 in the spike venv the helper raised
    `SystemExit` naming *the wheel's METADATA* -- so a fact about the staging
    source read as a fact about the wheel, and it blocked the iOS harness too,
    which imports the same function. That is checked here by behaviour rather
    than by reading the source, because the next edit that reintroduces it will
    not spell it the same way.

What this file does NOT do is run a wheel. The runtime harnesses take minutes,
boot simulators and emulators, and reach the network; the gate runs on every
commit. The live case here is the cheapest possible one -- spawn the already-built
simulator launcher and ask it for `sys.platform` -- and it **skips by name** when
no simulator is booted, because a check that quietly passes when its subject is
absent is the shape `CLAUDE.md` §5.5 is about.
