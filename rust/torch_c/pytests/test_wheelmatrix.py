"""Are the nine wheel targets real, and does each one's tag mean what it says?

`tools/wheel/build.py` grew from one architecture per platform to two
(docs/platform/WHEELMATRIX.md). That change is almost entirely *parameterisation* -- one
`AndroidTarget` became two, one `LinuxTarget` became two, one `WindowsTarget`
became two -- and parameterisation is the shape of change this repository has
been burned by before, because the second instance inherits the first one's
constants without saying so. Three concrete instances, all of which this file
would have caught and none of which any existing test did:

  * `_confirm_pep600_spelling` checked a floor of glibc 2.5, which is PEP 600's
    grammatical floor and is *correct for x86-64 only*. `manylinux_2_12_aarch64`
    passes that check and matches no installer: aarch64 is not in PEP 513 or PEP
    571, so pip's own generator floors it at 2.17. A tag no installer generates
    is a wheel nobody can install, and it looks exactly like a working one on
    the machine that built it.
  * `verify_linux.py` and `verify_windows.py` resolved every wheel's symbols
    against a *hardcoded* x86-64 distribution. Because `libpython3.13.so` and
    `python3.dll` export the same names on both architectures, an aarch64 wheel
    checked against the x86-64 interpreter prints `0 unresolved` and PASSes.
    The check does not fail; it stops being a check.
  * `TARGETS` is a dict comprehension keyed on `t.key`. Two entries sharing a
    key collapse into one silently, leaving eight targets where nine were
    written -- and the survivor is a perfectly good target, just not the one
    that went missing.

So this file asserts three things about each target: its **tag** is a name
`packaging` -- pip's own code -- would accept, its **place in the registry** is
held rather than assumed, and if it **refuses** it does so by name with a
reason. It builds nothing and needs no network; the cases that read a target
CPython distribution skip by name when it is absent, because a check that could
not run must not read as one that passed.

    takes) used to leave `run_pip_wheel`'s host-tagged intermediate sitting in
    `--outdir` -- twice today, from failed `linux-x86_64` and
    `wasm32-emscripten` runs, as a `...-macosx_11_0_universal2.whl` nobody
    asked for. `main()` now stages through a `TemporaryDirectory` and only
    moves the wheel into `--outdir` after `verify()` passes, so a failure
    there must leave `--outdir` exactly as empty as it started.

    Every stage but `run_pip_wheel`/`_repack`/`verify` is stubbed here: this
    machine has no vendored torch tree, so `preflight()` and `check_host_shim()`
    would refuse before ever reaching the code this test is about. The stub for
    `run_pip_wheel` writes a real file into whatever directory it is handed --
    that is the fact this test needs to observe -- and the stub for `verify`
    is where the injected failure happens.

    NULLIFICATION: run this same body against the pre-fix shape (`run_pip_wheel`
    writing straight to `args.outdir`, no staging) and the assertion that
    `outdir` is empty after the failure goes red -- confirmed by hand while
    writing this fix (see PR/commit description); a hardcoded pre-fix `main`
    is not duplicated here because it would drift from the real one silently.
