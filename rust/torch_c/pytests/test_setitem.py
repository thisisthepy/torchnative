"""`TensorBase.__setitem__` -- the stepped-slice write, and the one form the
297-architecture sweep is actually blocked on.

docs/architectures/ARCH100.md §2 ranks `TensorBase.__setitem__` first: 13 of the 82 blocked
architectures stop there, more than any other single name. Running those 13
(docs/bindings/SETITEM.md §1) shows they do not spread across `__setitem__`'s many
overloaded index forms at all. **All 13 stop on one form** -- a slice with
`step != 1` on the left of an assignment -- in exactly two shapes:

    pe[:, 0::2]        = <matrix>   3 arch, all at CONSTRUCTION
    freqs_t[..., k::3] = <rank-3>   10 arch, in the forward

So this file is not a survey of `__setitem__`. It is about the stepped write,
and it is written so that it stays a check on **both** sides of the change
docs/bindings/SETITEM.md §2 describes: while the form still refuses, it must refuse by
name and must never silently no-op; once the lowering lands, it must produce
upstream's values element for element.

That two-sided shape is deliberate. The refusal exists because
`aten.slice.Tensor` materialises above step 1 (docs/kernels/VIEWS.md §6.4), so the
natural walk narrows to a tensor that does *not* share storage with the
receiver -- and a write into that tensor is lost with no error at all. A test
that only pinned "it raises" would have to be deleted when the lowering lands,
and a test that only pinned the values would be red until then. Neither is a
check across the transition; this is.

Every number below was measured against upstream torch 2.13.0 in a separate
process (`env -u PYTHONPATH -u TORCH_USE_RTLD_GLOBAL`), not derived.
