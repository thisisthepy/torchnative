"""Does `tools/release/publish_main.sh` produce a `main` that is both clean and
shippable -- and can either of those two claims actually fail?

`main` is a published snapshot of `develop` with the development apparatus
removed. Two things can go wrong and they fail in opposite directions:

  * a path that should have been dropped survives, and the release quietly
    ships 179 documents of internal notes;
  * a path that should have been KEPT is dropped, and the release is a
    beautifully tidy branch that cannot build the wheel it is a snapshot of.

The leak check sees only the first. It would pass a tree with no `vendor/` and
no `tools/wheel/` without a murmur -- which is why the script also builds, and
why the tests below spend most of their effort proving that the build check is
invoked rather than declared (CLAUDE.md 5.5).

Every assertion here is nullified by construction: the leak test runs a
DELIBERATELY BROKEN copy of the script and requires it to go red, and the build
test runs the script against a fixture whose build succeeds and then against
one whose build fails, requiring different verdicts. A test that only ever ran
the working script would be measuring nothing.
