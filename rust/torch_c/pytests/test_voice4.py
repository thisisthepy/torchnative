"""docs/architectures/VOICE4.md -- the first voicestudio model run end to end, and the wall
that a coverage list structurally could not see.

Seven rounds of `docs/VOICE*.md` closed operators that speech models *tripped
over*, one wall at a time, and none of them ever ran a voicestudio model
through. This round picked one -- **BigVGAN v2 24 kHz 100-band 256x**, the
vocoder voicestudio's F5-TTS and CosyVoice hold as a submodel -- loaded the real
NVIDIA checkpoint (112,414,512 parameters), and vocoded one second of real
speech. It agrees with upstream to **5.69e-05 relative** on the waveform, inside
the 2.71e-04 that upstream's own float32-vs-float64 error allows, and it is
**closer to the float64 truth than upstream's own float32 answer is** (ratio
0.61).

The finding this file exists to hold down is that the round's first answer was
wrong in a way its own method guaranteed:

  * **Every operator BigVGAN dispatches was already in `_aten_implemented()`.**
    14 distinct ops in the forward, 15 in `__init__`, 0 missing -- so the round
    reported no wall. Then the model was actually run, and it stopped twice, on
    `aten.sum.default` and `aten.view.default`: both on that list, both with
    dense kernels and golden cases for months, and **neither with a meta
    kernel**. `from_pretrained` builds on meta, so the list was answering a
    different question than the one being asked.
    `test_the_two_meta_kernels_are_the_meta_half_of_ops_already_implemented`
    asserts that shape from both sides so it cannot be forgotten.

  * **A coverage claim read off a manifest is vacuous if the manifest is
    empty.** "Every op in the list is implemented" passes trivially for an empty
    list, and that is precisely the nullification a later edit would not notice.
    `test_the_bigvgan_op_manifest_cannot_pass_by_being_empty` asserts the
    manifest's size *and* names the four operators that are load bearing for
    this model specifically (`replication_pad1d`, `kaiser_window.beta`, `sinc`,
    `convolution`), so truncating it fails rather than passes.

  * **The tolerance is not a choice.** docs/numerics/AGREE.md derives its number from
    upstream's own float32-vs-float64 error, and so does this one: upstream
    BigVGAN disagrees with *itself* across those two dtypes by **6.78e-05
    relative** on the waveform, which is ~57x the 1.186e-06 that AGREE.md's
    297-architecture sweep used. A 112M-parameter convolutional vocoder
    accumulates far more than the median architecture in that sweep, and a
    round that used AGREE.md's constant here would be calling upstream wrong.
    `test_the_tolerance_is_read_off_upstreams_own_error_not_chosen` recomputes
    it from the recorded measurement so it cannot be quietly widened.

`voice4_bigvgan_ops.json` is the measurement, captured on upstream torch 2.13.0
under `TorchDispatchMode`; `voice4_capture.py` regenerates it.

The replay under the shim needs the vendored tree *and* a converted checkpoint,
neither of which is hermetic, so it is behind `TORCH_C_VOICE4_ASSETS` and skips
loudly rather than silently passing when they are absent. docs/architectures/VOICE4.md §5 is
what it measured when it was run by hand.
