/* Layer-3 part three: can the *PyO3 extension module* be dlopen'ed on
 * Emscripten, and does its `PyInit_` run?
 *
 * 7.4 loaded the candle-only cdylib and proved the loader works. This loads the
 * one with `abi3-py313` + `extension-module`, which additionally imports 54
 * CPython symbols (45 functions from "env", 9 data symbols from "GOT.mem").
 * Those are what a real interpreter would supply. There is no CPython built for
 * this target on this machine, so this program supplies them itself, from
 * `pystubs_gen.h`, generated out of the side module's own import table.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT DECIDE -- stated up front so the result is not
 * over-read:
 *
 *   CAN:  that Emscripten's dynamic loader resolves all 54 CPython symbols
 *         against a host module by name, both the function and the GOT.mem
 *         data halves, and instantiates our extension;
 *         that `PyInit_wasm_probe` is exported, found by `dlsym`, and *runs*;
 *         that it returns the module definition PyO3 built, with the right
 *         `m_name`, correctly relocated into the shared linear memory.
 *
 *   CANNOT: that `import torch` works. These are stubs. Nothing here refcounts,
 *         allocates a PyObject, or executes interpreter code. A real answer
 *         needs a Pyodide distribution -- see docs/WASM.md 7.6.
 *
 * Build:
 *   emcc pyinit_host.c -fwasm-exceptions -sMAIN_MODULE=1 -sNODERAWFS=1 -o py.js
