/* Layer-3 part two: does Emscripten's dlopen actually load our cdylib and run
 * code out of it?
 *
 * This is the question docs/WASM.md §3a puts at the centre of the whole
 * feasibility argument. WASI has no dlopen, so on WASI `torch._C` cannot be a
 * wheel at all -- it would have to be compiled into the interpreter. Emscripten
 * is claimed to have dlopen. That claim is read from CPython/Pyodide policy
 * documents in §3, not measured. This measures it, on our actual artefact.
 *
 * Deliberately CPython-free. The side module loaded here is the *candle-only*
 * cdylib, not the PyO3 one, so that "does the dynamic loader work" is separated
 * from "can the 54 CPython symbols be resolved" (§7.5). Mixing them would give a
 * failure that could be blamed on either.
 *
 * Built for the host too, as a control: if this program cannot dlopen a plain
 * macOS .dylib then a wasm failure would say nothing about wasm.
 *
 *   host:  cc dlopen_host.c -o host_dl
 *   wasm:  emcc dlopen_host.c -sMAIN_MODULE=1 -o dl.js --preload-file <side>
