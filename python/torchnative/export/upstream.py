"""The `torch.export` census names — **moved, and this is what is left.**

`docs/graph/EXPORT.md` §8 described this module as "a staging area, not the final
home" and wrote the patch that would move it.  `docs/graph/EXPORT4.md` §10 listed
paying that debt as the next mechanical task.  `docs/graph/EXPORT5.md` §7 paid it:
every implementation that used to live here is now in
`crates/torch_c/src/bootstrap.py`, installed at the end of its `install()`,
before any `from torch._C import ...` in the vendored tree has run.

**Nothing in this file implements anything any more.**  What is left is a
forwarder, kept for one reason and one reason only: several existing tests
(`test_export.py`, `test_export4.py`, `test_dispatch.py`) reach for
`upstream.install()`, `upstream._RAII_GUARDS` and friends, and pointing those
at the bootstrap's copies is what makes them start testing the **final home**
rather than a staging area that no longer exists.  Deleting the file outright
would have deleted those tests with it.

Why the monkey-patch had to go, restated because it is the point of the move:
installing after `import torch` meant a `rebind()` pass over roughly forty
`from torch._C import ...` bindings that other torch modules had already made
— including aliases like `torch/utils/_mode_utils.py:15`'s
``no_dispatch = torch._C._DisableTorchDispatch``, which is why that pass had to
match by object identity rather than by name.  All of it is gone.

And the measurement that made it urgent rather than tidy: before the move,
`tests/export_sweep.py` run against the shim stopped at census
name #0 (`torch._C._unset_dispatch_mode`) on **every** architecture, because
the sweep's subprocess never called `install()`.  Every export number in
`docs/graph/EXPORT.md` and `docs/graph/EXPORT4.md` was taken under the patch, and
`docs/graph/EXPORT4.md` §1.1 said so.  After the move the names are simply there.
