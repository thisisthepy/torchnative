"""Refuse a release whose git tag does not name the version being built.

    python .github/scripts/check_tag_version.py refs/tags/v0.1.0b3
    python .github/scripts/check_tag_version.py v0.1.0b3 --pyproject pyproject.toml

Nothing in this repository checked this before. `scripts/wheel/build.py` reads the
version out of the built metadata and never sees the tag; the workflow reads the
tag and never sees `pyproject.toml`. So `git tag v0.1.0b4 && git push --tags`
would have built, verified and published **0.1.0b3** under a release called
v0.1.0b4 -- nine wheels, all internally consistent, all the wrong version, and
the second attempt at the real 0.1.0b4 would then hit PyPI's "file already
exists" for a file nobody meant to upload. PyPI does not allow re-uploading a
filename even after deletion, so that mistake is not undoable.

The comparison is deliberately **not** `tag.lstrip("v") == version`:

* `packaging.version.Version` normalises, so `v0.1.0-beta3`, `v0.1.0b3` and
  `v0.1.0.b3` all parse to the same release. Comparing the parsed objects would
  accept a tag whose *text* is not the version -- and the tag text is what
  appears on the GitHub release page and in every `pip install
  torchnative==...` a reader copies from it. So the parsed forms must agree
  AND the literal strings must agree.
* An unparseable tag is a refusal, not a fallback to string equality. A tag of
  `vlatest` matching a `version = "latest"` would otherwise pass.

Exit 0 and print the version on agreement; exit 1 with the reason otherwise.
The version is also written to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` as `version=` when that
variable is set, so the workflow has exactly one place the number comes from.
