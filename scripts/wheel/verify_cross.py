"""Inspect a cross-built wheel. This is not the same judgement as verify.py.

    python scripts/wheel/verify_cross.py dist/torchnative-*-android_21_arm64_v8a.whl
    python scripts/wheel/verify_cross.py dist/torchnative-*-ios_12_0_arm64_iphoneos.whl
    python scripts/wheel/verify_cross.py dist/torchnative-*-pyemscripten_2026_0_wasm32.whl

`scripts/wheel/verify.py` proves a host wheel by installing it into a clean venv
and watching `torch.__file__` come out of that venv. Nothing here can do that:
there is no interpreter on this machine that an Android or iOS wheel is for.

So this checks the two things that *are* decidable from the artefact, and says
plainly that they are not the same claim:

  the tag is one an installer will match      PEP 738 / PEP 730 spelling, run
                                              through `packaging.tags`, which is
                                              the code pip itself uses
  the contents are for that platform          every Mach-O and ELF member read
                                              directly -- architecture, and for
                                              Apple the `LC_BUILD_VERSION`
                                              platform, which is the only thing
                                              distinguishing an iphoneos build
                                              from an iphonesimulator one
  the pieces `import torch` reaches for        `torch/_C.abi3.so` under a suffix
                                              this target's interpreter actually
                                              searches, the global-deps library
                                              under the name
                                              `_load_global_deps` computes, and
                                              the wall-4 marker
  the archive is internally consistent        RECORD hashes every member, which
                                              is what pip verifies on install

The four families do not all answer the same subset of those, and the report
says which. `pyemscripten_*_wasm32` is the widest gap and the newest: a
WebAssembly module has no symbol table, no version fields and no platform
record, so the "contents are for that platform" line above degrades to
"contents are wasm32, are `dlopen`-able, and export `PyInit__C`". The version
half of the tag -- the `2026_0` that pins Pyodide's ABI -- is checked against the
Pyodide distribution on this machine and *cannot* be checked against the
artefact, because nothing in a wasm module records it. See
`PyEmscriptenExpectation`, which lists the declined questions one by one rather
than answering nearby easier ones.

What it does NOT establish: that the extension loads, that `import torch`
completes, or that any kernel computes. For Android that gap is closed
separately by `scripts/wheel/verify_android.py`, which runs on a device. For iOS
it is open -- see docs/platform/WHEEL.md §7.

Exit 0 means every check above passed. Any failure prints `FAIL:` lines and
exits 1.

    Two things here have no counterpart in the Android and iOS branches.

    tag needs the glibc of the interpreter doing the matching -- it is not a
    function of arguments. So the tag is checked against PEP 600's grammar and

    the other two and says so.

    Second, the floor in the tag is a claim about *content*, not about a target

    `GLIBC_x.y` each image needs, and a wheel tagged below the highest of those
    installs onto a glibc that cannot load it. iOS's `minos` check is the same

    is an architecture, and that is checked against the PE header.

    """`pyemscripten_<abi-version>_wasm32` -- and the family that can answer least.

    Every other family here is checked against a *symbol table*. WebAssembly has
    none. What it has is an import section and an export section, which name
    every symbol the host must supply and every symbol offered, as strings, in
    the module. So the linkage questions get easier and the platform questions
    become unanswerable, and those two facts have to be reported separately
    rather than netted off against each other.

    **Answered here, from the artefact:**

      wasm32, not wasm64      the memory type's limits flags. A side module
                              imports its memory, so this is read from the
                              import section (`binfmt._wasm_memory_bits`).
      loadable at all         a side module imports `env.memory` and
                              `env.__indirect_function_table`; a main-module
                              link defines and exports them, and Emscripten's
                              `dlopen` refuses it. This is the wasm spelling of
                              "is it a DLL and not an EXE", and docs/platform/WASM.md
                              §9.2 hit it: `ctypes.CDLL` on the global-deps stub
                              is `dlopen`, so *both* wasm members have to be
                              side modules, not only the extension.
      `PyInit__C` is exported, and is a *function*. `dlsym` finds it and the
                              import system calls it; an export of that name
                              with kind `global` is a linker accident that fails
                              at import with nothing pointing at the module.
      nothing linked in that should not be -- `check_linkage` below.

    **Declined here, and each one is a question another family does answer:**

      the platform             Mach-O has `LC_BUILD_VERSION`; a wasm module
                               records no Emscripten version, no Pyodide ABI
                               version and no minimum anything. `2026_0` in the
                               tag is checked against `pyodide-lock.json`, which
                               is a check on *this machine's distribution*, not
                               on the wheel. If the wheel were built against a
                               different Pyodide, nothing in the wasm bytes
                               would say so.
      the abi3 binding         `WindowsExpectation` proves it by reading which
                               DLL each import is attributed to: `python3.dll`
                               and not `python313.dll`. Emscripten attributes
                               every undefined symbol to the single import
                               module `env`, so that distinction has no wasm
                               spelling. docs/platform/WASM.md §9.3 makes this less
                               costly than it sounds -- the platform tag pins
                               CPython 3.14 and Emscripten 5.0.3 together, so
                               the abi3 field is inert here -- but inert is not
                               checked, and it is reported as unchecked.
      a manylinux-style floor  no counterpart, same as Mach-O and Android.
      whether every import resolves. Only the Python C API subset is decidable;
                               see `check_linkage`.
