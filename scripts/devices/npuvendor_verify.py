"""Run this on a Windows machine with an NPU. It answers two SEPARATE questions.

    python scripts/devices/npuvendor_verify.py
    python scripts/devices/npuvendor_verify.py --dump-all

Stage A -- SELECTION. What this build *would* do: which candidate backends it
would try on this host in which order, and what the PCI/PnP enumeration says is
in the machine. Pure Python: stdlib `winreg` only, no OpenVINO, no QNN, no
vendor SDK, nothing executed on any accelerator. Runs anywhere; on a non-Windows
box it prints the named "could not look" answer, which is itself the thing
docs/devices/NPUVENDOR.md section 3.2 wants checked.

Stage B -- EXECUTION. Whether `torchnative.device.npu` actually resolves, which
runs the real probes and needs real hardware. It is the ONLY stage that is
evidence about hardware; Stage A is not, and says so.

Keeping them apart is intelnpu_verify.py's rule and it is here for the same
reason: a green Stage A on a machine with no NPU is still a true result about
selection, and reporting the two together is how a selection result gets read as
an execution claim.

What Stage A settles, from NPUVENDOR.md section 6's UNVERIFIED list:

  * whether HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Enum\\PCI is readable unelevated;
  * whether an Intel NPU really appears there as VEN_8086&DEV_<id>;
  * whether its CompatibleIDs really contain CC_1200 -- the vendor-neutral
    signal, which is worth much less than claimed if it is absent;
  * what Class/ClassGUID Windows gives it, since Microsoft documents no NPU
    device setup class.

Paste the Stage A block into the NPUVENDOR.md UNVERIFIED section's place.
