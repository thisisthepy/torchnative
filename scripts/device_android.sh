# The host end of `parity` is NOT the artefact we ship, and that is deliberate.
#
# The shipped Apple build links Accelerate (docs/PERF.md §3); the Android build
# cannot, and calls candle's `gemm` instead. Comparing those two ends bit for
# bit compares two different BLAS implementations, which can only ever restate
# something already known -- and it does so loudly enough (8 cases, 1-2 ULP) to
# bury the device-specific kernel fault this script exists to find. So the host
# end is rebuilt with the Accelerate exception switched off, which puts `gemm`
# on both ends and makes bit equality the right thing to demand again.
#
# What that costs: `parity` no longer says anything about the artefact Apple
# users receive. docs/DEVICE.md §5.1 carries that, because it is a real
# difference and not a defect, and it does not go away by being measured
