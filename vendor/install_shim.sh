# Build `rust/torch_c` for the host and drop it into the hole that
# `vendor_torch.sh` left in the vendored tree.
#
# The filename is `_C.abi3.so` (ABI3.md §7 item 2). Upstream ships
# `_C.cpython-313-darwin.so`; both are in importlib's EXTENSION_SUFFIXES, and
# the abi3 tag is the honest one for a Limited-API build.
#
# `cd` into the crate rather than using `--manifest-path`: cargo discovers
# `.cargo/config.toml` from the working directory, and without it the host link
# loses `-undefined dynamic_lookup` (docs/TORCH_C.md §3).

# `torch/__init__.py:2179 _manager_path()` refuses to import unless
# `torch/bin/torch_shm_manager` exists on disk -- unconditionally, on every
# non-Windows platform. It is the helper process for sharing tensor storages
# between OS processes; on a phone there is nothing to share with, and we are
# never going to ship it.
#
# Only *existence* is checked here; the path is handed to `_initExtension` and
# is not executed until someone actually uses `torch.multiprocessing`. So a
# zero-byte marker is enough, and it is left as a marker rather than quietly
# fixed up so that the requirement stays visible. Recorded as wall 4 in
# docs/VENDOR.md.
