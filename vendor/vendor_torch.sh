# Vendor the upstream PyTorch *Python* tree, and nothing else.
#
# "The tree" is the three top-level packages the torch distribution installs --
# `torch`, `torchgen`, `functorch` -- not just `torch`. See the `siblings` loop
# below for why copying only the first one hid a missing dependency for months.
#
# DESIGN.md §2 is the bet this script exists to test: "파이썬 계층은 벤더링하고
# `_C` 만 교체한다". That sentence is only meaningful if the vendored tree has
# exactly one hole in it, so the copy is defined by what it *drops*:
#
#   torch/lib/         353 MB of libtorch/libc10 dylibs -- the native runtime
#   torch/include/      61 MB of C++ headers, build inputs only
#   torch/bin/           7 MB of host tools
#   torch/test/          upstream's own test binaries
#   *.so *.dylib *.a     every compiled artefact anywhere in the tree
#
# In torch 2.13.0 that last line removes exactly one file from the Python tree:
# `_C.cpython-313-darwin.so`. Everything else under `torch/` is Python source.
# That is the measurement, not an assumption -- `find` it yourself if in doubt.
#
# The result is a torch that cannot import until `install_shim.sh` puts our
# `_C` in the hole, which is the property we want: if the tree could import
# without it, the experiment would be proving nothing.
#
# The tree is NOT committed (see /.gitignore). It is ~1084 modules and tens of
# megabytes of third-party source; this script is the reproduction.

# The torch *distribution* is three top-level packages, not one --

# `torchgen`. Only `torch` used to be copied, and for the PYTHONPATH workflow
# that was invisible: `$PWD/torchnative/src/main` shadows site-packages for
# `torch`, and `torchgen`/`functorch` then quietly resolved to the *upstream
# install* underneath. So "import torch completes" was measured with two thirds
# of the distribution supplied by the reference installation.
#
# It stops being invisible the moment the tree is packaged into a wheel and put
# on a machine that has no upstream torch: `torch/nn/modules/module.py:17` ->
# `torch/utils/_python_dispatch.py:13` -> `import torchgen`, and the import dies
# 2254 lines into `torch/__init__.py`. Recorded in docs/WHEEL.md.
